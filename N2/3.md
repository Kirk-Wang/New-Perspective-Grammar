# 谓语动词的时态（下）

Lesson 12:一般将来时

Lesson 7:过去进行时/过去完成时/过去将来时

### 一般将来时
* 谓语v. = will do -> 多半指临时决定，包含个人意愿（区别可以不记）
* am/is/are going to do -> 事先有计划、打算好的（区别可以不记）
* 用法：表示(现在的)将来的事
  * Don't worry. Everything will be fine.
  * My sister is going to study abroad next year.

**一般将来时 变否定/疑问**
|:-:|:-:|
|He `will` leave.|He `is` going to leave.|
|He `will not` leave.|He `is not` going to leave.|
|`Will` he leave?|`Is` he going to leave?|
|What `will` he do?|What `is` he going to do?|

**Lesson 12: Goodbye and good luck**

1.Our neighbour, Captain Charles Alison(同位语), `will sail` from Portsmouth tomorrow.
  * `proud`-> I am proud of you.

2.We`'ll meet` him at the harbour early in the morning.

3.He `will be` in his small boat, Topsail.

4.It `has sailed` across the Atlantic many times.
  * `has sailed` -> 现在完成时

5.Captain Alison `will set` out at eight o'clock, so we`'ll have` plenty of time.
  * `plenty of time` 充足的时间

6.We'`ll see` his boat and then we'`ll say` goodbye to him.

7.He `will be` away `for two months`.
* be away -> 离开,`be` 动词的词组通常表示出于某种状态，而状态都是可以持续的
* `for` 表示持续一段时间

**leave**-> `离开` -> 瞬间动词，它是不能延续的,所以这里不能用
* He will leave.
* He will leave for two months. 🙅‍♂️×，不能接一段时间

**die**瞬间动词
* The old man has died for ten years. ❌
* The old man has died
* The old man has been dead for ten years.
  * be + adj. -> 表示状态，可以持续

8.We are very proud of him.

9. He `will take` part in an important race across the Atlantic.

### 过去进行时
* 谓语v. = was/were + doing
* 用法1：表示过去正在进行的事

He `was working` at 3:00 yesterday.

While you `were sleeping`, a thief sneaked in.
* `过去进行时`铺垫故事背景
* `一般过去时`通常表示突发的状况
* `两种时态` 常常搭配在一块儿用

变否定/疑问

### 过去完成时

**谓语v. = had + done**

**过去的之前**

**用法1：表示过去的之前（全部完成/部分完成）的事**

Before 8 o'clock yesterday, she `had finished` her homework.

When he got there, she `had left`.She was not there.

变否定/疑问

### 区别：过去完成时 vs. 现在完成时

It is 10:00. I have waited(wait) for 2 hours.
* 很明显 -> 这里是站在现在看之前

It was 10:00. I had waited(wait) for 2 hours.
* 很明显 -> 这里是站在过去看之前
