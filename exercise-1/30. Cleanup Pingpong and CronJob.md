Before we move to the next lecture, you need to clean up.

You can use a delete command for that.

Here's an example of what you should do if you've

been watching all the lectures before this.

We have the pingpong deployment, and then the cron job

called sleep. You can even put those in a single line

as long as you're putting the resource type, and then

the name right next to it with a slash.

You can do multiple ones of those in one liner.

See you in the next lecture.
