Let's try a few more get commands to see how

we can look at other resources.

We can at least get lists of other resources with the get

command. Again, there's lots of resources.

Technically, there's dozens of them throughout this cluster

system for Kubernetes, but we're not going to talk about

all of those just yet.

Let's just show a quick example of listing services.

kubectl get services.

If you saw on that slide, there is also a shorter version

of that command, kubectl get svc.

Remember, we got that from the kubectl api

-resources list, which shows us all of the resources in

our cluster and then also the shortcuts, if there are any,

for that particular command.

We've got these two ways to do it.

It's the same, exact result.

We're going to talk more about services later.

Just so you know, for now, services are

a stable endpoint to access a set of pods.

Even if it's just one pod. If you need to access that from

other pods in your cluster, or for something outside

your pod, you're going to be creating services.

We're going to do a lot of that throughout this course.

We'll be getting into the different types of services and

their features later on.

Let's see another get command as an example.

This is probably the most popular command, or definitely

one of the top five, you will use as basic administrator

of anything Kubernetes.

It's the Kubernetes version

of docker ps, or docker container ls.

This is listing all your pods, which again, we

can't list containers.

The closest thing we can get to that is to list the pods.

So, let's do that now.

We type in kubectl get pods.

If you're like me, you're going to get back no resources

found in the default namespace, which is an

interesting error.

It doesn't seem to be an error.

But, it's talking about this default namespace.

Well, what is a namespace?

We haven't discussed that yet. That's an important topic

that's going to come up next.
