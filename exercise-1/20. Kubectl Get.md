Let's try a few more get commands to see how

we can look at other resources.

让我们再尝试几个 get 命令，看看如何查看其他资源。

We can at least get lists of other resources with the get

command. Again, there's lots of resources.

我们至少可以使用 get 命令获得其他资源的列表。还有很多资源。

Technically, there's dozens of them throughout this cluster

system for Kubernetes, but we're not going to talk about

all of those just yet.

从技术上讲，在 Kubernetes 集群系统中有几十个这样的节点，
但是我们现在还不打算讨论所有这些节点。

Let's just show a quick example of listing services.

让我们展示一个列出服务的快速示例。

kubectl get services.

If you saw on that slide, there is also a shorter version

of that command, kubectl get svc.

如果你在那张幻灯片上看到，这个命令还有一个更短的版本，kubectl get svc。

Remember, we got that from the kubectl api

-resources list, which shows us all of the resources in

our cluster and then also the shortcuts, if there are any,

for that particular command.

请记住，我们是从 kubectl api-resources 列表中获得的，
它向我们显示了集群中的所有资源，
如果有的话，
还显示了该特定命令的快捷方式。

We've got these two ways to do it.

我们有两种方法。

It's the same, exact result.

结果是一样的。

We're going to talk more about services later.

稍后我们将更多地讨论服务。

Just so you know, for now, services are

a stable endpoint to access a set of pods.

正如您所知道的，目前服务是访问一组 pod 的稳定端点。

Even if it's just one pod. If you need to access that from

other pods in your cluster, or for something outside

your pod, you're going to be creating services.

即使只是一个 pod。
如果您需要从集群中的其他 pod 访问它，
或者需要访问 pod 之外的内容，
那么您将创建服务。

We're going to do a lot of that throughout this course.

We'll be getting into the different types of services and

their features later on.

Let's see another get command as an example.

This is probably the most popular command, or definitely

one of the top five, you will use as basic administrator

of anything Kubernetes.

It's the Kubernetes version

of docker ps, or docker container ls.

This is listing all your pods, which again, we

can't list containers.

The closest thing we can get to that is to list the pods.

So, let's do that now.

We type in kubectl get pods.

If you're like me, you're going to get back no resources

found in the default namespace, which is an

interesting error.

It doesn't seem to be an error.

But, it's talking about this default namespace.

Well, what is a namespace?

We haven't discussed that yet. That's an important topic

that's going to come up next.
