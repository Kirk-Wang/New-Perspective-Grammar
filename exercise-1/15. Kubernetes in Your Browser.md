This video is for those of you that are maybe doing

this on a tablet, which is fine.

It's just going to be a little more challenging for you.

We're in the days where it's possible now to do real work

on a tablet. And in fact, on my iPad with

the latest release of iPad OS this year, I've been able to

shell into servers and do multi-split

screen stuff apps.

It's just it's a real-world scenario where you can

actually use a tablet today.

So, in case you're one of those lucky people that has a

tablet and you are considering web options.

Well, it might be better for you to just shell into a

server from an ssh prompt because the web

options, personally, I find pretty limiting and

frustrating. But, let's go through them anyway just so you

know what the options are.

All of these options are free.

They do have paid versions sometimes, but they're all

generally free to use for most things with what's called

a playground.

They're really easy get started.

It's just a website you go to.

You might not even have to log in, depending on the

solution. But the reality is, I've tried

these simplistic Kubernetes setups

over the last year a lot.

And they just aren't always reliable.

They're not always the latest versions.

And a lot of the demos that I want to give you may not

work on them, just depending on whether it has enough

resources or it might be too slow at that time.

It might run out of space.

There's just all sorts of issues I've had.

So, just a warning.

If you try these and it's frustrating, that's because

they're free. So, maybe it's worth checking

out my Linux setup and using microk8s

with a DigitalOcean $5 a month server,

which I think is way better option.

It allows you to use an ssh tool on your tablet,

or machine, or Chromebook or whatever you have.

Raspberry Pi, you know, even on your phone, you could do

a ssh on that on a $5 DigitalOcean server

pretty quickly. Wouldn't take you 10 minutes to set it up.

There's a coupon in this video in case you want to do that.

It gives you a full month of free use on DigitalOcean

for three or four servers.

So, you can try that. But if you want to do the Web

options, there are at least four of them that I've listed

here. There's Katacoda, there's play-with-k8s,

which is from Docker.

There's OpenShift from Red Hat.

Then there's another one called Instrucqt.

I think it's how you say it. ... Not

sure how you say that.

... Let me know in the questions and comments what

you think that one is because I don't know how to say that

one. But they all result in the exact, same scenario.

You have a shell emulator in a browser.

There's supposedly a real server on the backend.

Depending on the right time of day, you may

have enough resources to do this work.

So, if you have to use one of these, I hope they work well

for you. Good luck.
