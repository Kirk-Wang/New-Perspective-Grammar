This video is for those of you that are maybe doing

this on a tablet, which is fine.

这个视频是为那些可能在平板电脑上做这个的人准备的，这很好。

It's just going to be a little more challenging for you.

这对你来说会更有挑战性。

We're in the days where it's possible now to do real work

on a tablet. And in fact, on my iPad with

the latest release of iPad OS this year, I've been able to

shell into servers and do multi-split

screen stuff apps.

我们处在一个可以在平板电脑上进行实际工作的时代。
事实上，在我的 iPad 上，今年最新发布的 iPad 操作系统，
我已经能够进入服务器，并做多屏应用程序。

It's just it's a real-world scenario where you can

actually use a tablet today.

它只是一个现实世界的场景，你今天可以真正使用平板电脑。
* scenario n. 方案；情节；剧本；设想

So, in case you're one of those lucky people that has a

tablet and you are considering web options.

所以，如果你是那些幸运的拥有平板电脑的人之一，你正在考虑 web 选项。
* consider vt. 考虑；认为；考虑到；细想 

Well, it might be better for you to just shell into a

server from an ssh prompt because the web

options, personally, I find pretty limiting and

frustrating. But, let's go through them anyway just so you

know what the options are.

好吧，对你来说，
从ssh提示符直接进入一个服务器可能更好，
因为我个人认为 web 选项非常有限而且令人沮丧。
但是，不管怎样，让我们来看看，这样你就知道有什么选择了。
* personally adv.就本人而言;就个人意见;本人;亲自;个别地;单个地
* limiting adj.限制性的
* frustrating adj.令人懊恼的;令人沮丧的
* anyway adv. 无论如何，不管怎样；总之

All of these options are free.

They do have paid versions sometimes, but they're all

generally free to use for most things with what's called

a playground.

所有这些选项都是免费的。
他们有时确实有付费版本，
但他们通常都是免费使用的，大多数东西都有所谓的 playground。

They're really easy get started.

It's just a website you go to.

You might not even have to log in, depending on the

solution. But the reality is, I've tried

these simplistic Kubernetes setups

over the last year a lot.

And they just aren't always reliable.

They're not always the latest versions.

And a lot of the demos that I want to give you may not

work on them, just depending on whether it has enough

resources or it might be too slow at that time.

It might run out of space.

There's just all sorts of issues I've had.

So, just a warning.

If you try these and it's frustrating, that's because

they're free. So, maybe it's worth checking

out my Linux setup and using microk8s

with a DigitalOcean $5 a month server,

which I think is way better option.

It allows you to use an ssh tool on your tablet,

or machine, or Chromebook or whatever you have.

Raspberry Pi, you know, even on your phone, you could do

a ssh on that on a $5 DigitalOcean server

pretty quickly. Wouldn't take you 10 minutes to set it up.

There's a coupon in this video in case you want to do that.

It gives you a full month of free use on DigitalOcean

for three or four servers.

So, you can try that. But if you want to do the Web

options, there are at least four of them that I've listed

here. There's Katacoda, there's play-with-k8s,

which is from Docker.

There's OpenShift from Red Hat.

Then there's another one called Instrucqt.

I think it's how you say it. ... Not

sure how you say that.

... Let me know in the questions and comments what

you think that one is because I don't know how to say that

one. But they all result in the exact, same scenario.

You have a shell emulator in a browser.

There's supposedly a real server on the backend.

Depending on the right time of day, you may

have enough resources to do this work.

So, if you have to use one of these, I hope they work well

for you. Good luck.
