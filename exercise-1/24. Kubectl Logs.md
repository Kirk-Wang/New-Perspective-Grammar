As you would expect, just like with Docker, you have

a built-in logs command. So, we can use kubectl logs

to look at resources that are related to pods.

正如您所期望的，就像 Docker 一样，
您有一个内置的日志命令。
因此，我们可以使用 kubectl logs 查看与 pods 相关的资源。

In this case, we can ask for deploy because that's

the thing we created with the run command.

在本例中，我们可以请求 deploy，因为它是我们用 run 命令创建的。

We created a deployment, but deploy is also one of the

shortcut words you can use instead of typing out the full

word deployment. So, we can use kubectl logs

deploy/pingpong.

我们创建了一个 deployment，
但是 deploy 也是一个快捷词，
您可以使用它来代替键入完整的单词 deployment。
因此，我们可以使用 kubectl logs deploy/pingpong。

You should see a dump of a bunch

of pings to that same IP address.

应该会看到一堆指向同一 IP 地址的 ping 信号。

Assuming you have Internet connectivity to that IP address

from your machine, which you don't have to have for this

example. But, assuming you do, you're going to see the

sequence of all these different pings.

假设您的计算机有到该 IP 地址的 Internet 连接，
在本例中不必这样做。
但是，假设你这样做了，
你会看到所有这些不同 ping 的序列。
* sequence n.一系列;一连串;顺序;次序;(电影中表现同一主题或场面的)一组镜头
* connectivity n.连接(度);联结(度)

They're just going to count up forever while that pod is

running.

他们会一直数下去，而那个豆荚还在运行。
* count up 计算总数

I want to point out here that this is only getting us

one pod.

我想指出的是这只给我们带来了一个 pod。

So, in our deployment, it will have a ReplicaSet,

and we could specify that ReplicaSet's name or the logs

command. Or, we could specify an exact pod

in that logs command. Because the limits of

the log command is that it will only return the logs from a

single pod, it's essentially just going to pick one

of the pods in the deployment.

因此，在我们的部署中，
它将有一个 ReplicaSet，
我们可以指定 ReplicaSet 的名称或 logs 命令。
或者，我们可以在日志命令中指定一个确切的 pod。
因为 log 命令的限制是它只返回来自单个 pod 的日志，
所以本质上它只选择部署中的一个 pod。

In our case, we only have one pod.

在我们的例子中，我们只有一个 pod。

So, easy. But, what if we scale this up?

所以，简单点。但是，如果我们扩大规模呢？

There's a kubectl scale command which

allows us to, you guessed it, scale

our replicas higher than one.

有一个 kubectl scale 命令，
它允许我们，你猜对了，
将副本的规模扩大到一个以上。

Like most things, including Docker

run, and Swarm, and every other orchestrator out there,

if you create something that has a container,

it's going to default to one replica or one container.

和大多数东西一样，
包括 Docker run，Swarm，
以及其他所有的编排器，
如果你创建了一个容器，
它将默认为一个副本或一个容器。

In this case, we created one pod by default with the run

command.

在本例中，我们使用 run 命令默认创建了一个 pod。

But, we can add more.

但是，我们可以添加更多。

We could have done that with the run command.

我们可以使用 run 命令实现这一点。

But in this case, we're going to use the kubectl scale

command to change the total replicates.

但是在本例中，我们将使用 kubectl scale 命令来更改总复制数。

kubectl scale deploy.

Remember, we can use that short name.

记住，我们可以用那个简短的名字。

pingpong.

As a reminder, this is not adding three replicas.

提醒一下，这不是添加三个副本。

This is changing the declarative

spec of the deployment.

这改变了部署的声明性规范。

Meaning that there is no add or remove.

意味着没有添加或删除。

It's simply, this is what I want you to have.

很简单，这就是我想要的。

I don't have to know what you previously had in terms of

replicas. I just know I want you to have a total of three

now. It could have had 300.

我不需要知道你之前的 replicas。
我只知道我想让你们现在一共有三个。
它可以有 300 个。
* in terms of 在…方面;从…角度看;根据…来说
* a total of 总数为

We don't have to know.

我们不必知道。

We're just telling it, please scale this to this new

number. Of course, in this second example,

we could use the space, and we could type out the name

completely. You could have typed deployment space

pingpong or deployment /pingpong.

我们只是告诉它，
请把这个缩放到新的数字。
当然，在第二个例子中，
我们可以使用空格，我们可以完整地输入名字。
您可以键入 deployment 空格 pingpong
或 deployment /pingpong。

It's a little bit flexible in that way.

它在这方面有点灵活。

Something to note here is that just because these

different resource objects exist doesn't mean

we should mess with them.

这里需要注意的是，
仅仅因为存在这些不同的资源对象
并不意味着我们应该处理它们。

Kubernetes is super flexible.

Kubernetes 非常灵活。

We could technically go in and change

the spec of the ReplicaSet.

我们可以从技术上改变 ReplicaSet 的规格。

But, what would happen is because the deployment spec is

managing the replicas, and it's creating the ReplicaSet

itself, it knows what the ReplicaSet's supposed to

但是，因为 deployment spec 是管理副本的，
它自己创建副本集，它知道副本集应该是什么。
* supposed to 应该

be. So, it's going to change that after we muck

with it. That's one of the ways these different objects

manage each other is they're constantly evaluating what

it thinks that they should be versus what they really

所以，在我们摆弄它之后，它会改变这一点。
这是这些不同对象相互管理的一种方式
它们不断地评估它认为
它们应该是什么
和它们实际是什么。
* constantly adv.始终;一直;重复不断地
* evaluating v.估计;评价;评估
* versus prep.(表示两队或双方对阵)对，诉，对抗;(比较两种不同想法、选择等)与…相对，与…相比

are. If we went in and mucked around with stuff, it would

change that. Let's go back to that logs command for a

second

just to reiterate some of the features.

如果我们进去随便弄点东西，情况就会改变。
让我们回到 log 命令，
只是为了重申一些特性。
* reiterate v.反复地说;重申

Like Docker logs, this has other options like --tail and

--follow. We can do that as well...tail

1, which basically says only give me

the last line and that's good in case you have

huge amounts of logs, right.

If you have production systems, these things, based on your

settings, will have a large amount of logs on the host

where the container is running.

You may not want to stream all that over the network to

your local shell in case you're on a multi-node

setup. By tail 1, I'm saying only

return the last and then

follow lets me stay streaming

for any future logs.

There we go. You'll notice there it said found three pods

using this pod.

That's a limitation. Again, I mentioned that earlier that

logs command can only see one pod at a time.

It's thinking that in a deployment,

they're all the same. I'm just going to pick one, and I'm

going to give it back to you.

You can specify each pod directly.

You would have to go and do a get pods command

to see the list of them.

Then, pull the exact name of them because they're not named

just pingpong. They're named pingpong with that extra ID on

them. You'd have to specify that if you wanted to look at a

specific pod.
