As you would expect, just like with Docker, you have

a built-in logs command. So, we can use kubectl logs

to look at resources that are related to pods.

In this case, we can ask for deploy because that's

the thing we created with the run command.

We created a deployment, but deploy is also one of the

shortcut words you can use instead of typing out the full

word deployment. So, we can use kubectl logs

deploy/pingpong.

You should see a dump of a bunch

of pings to that same IP address.

Assuming you have Internet connectivity to that IP address

from your machine, which you don't have to have for this

example. But, assuming you do, you're going to see the

sequence of all these different pings.

They're just going to count up forever while that pod is

running.

I want to point out here that this is only getting us

one pod.

So, in our deployment, it will have a ReplicaSet,

and we could specify that ReplicaSet's name or the logs

command. Or, we could specify an exact pod

in that logs command. Because the limits of

the log command is that it will only return the logs from a

single pod, it's essentially just going to pick one

of the pods in the deployment.

In our case, we only have one pod.

So, easy. But, what if we scale this up?

There's a kubectl scale command which

allows us to, you guessed it, scale

our replicas higher than one.

Like most things, including Docker

run, and Swarm, and every other orchestrator out there,

if you create something that has a container,

it's going to default to one replica or one container.

In this case, we created one pod by default with the run

command.

But, we can add more.

We could have done that with the run command.

But in this case, we're going to use the kubectl scale

command to change the total replicates.

kubectl scale deploy.

Remember, we can use that short name.

pingpong.

As a reminder, this is not adding three replicas.

This is changing the declarative

spec of the deployment.

Meaning that there is no add or remove.

It's simply, this is what I want you to have.

I don't have to know what you previously had in terms of

replicas. I just know I want you to have a total of three

now. It could have had 300.

We don't have to know.

We're just telling it, please scale this to this new

number. Of course, in this second example,

we could use the space, and we could type out the name

completely. You could have typed deployment space

pingpong or deployment /pingpong.

It's a little bit flexible in that way.

Something to note here is that just because these

different resource objects exist doesn't mean

we should mess with them.

Kubernetes is super flexible.

We could technically go in and change

the spec of the ReplicaSet.

But, what would happen is because the deployment spec is

managing the replicas, and it's creating the ReplicaSet

itself, it knows what the ReplicaSet's supposed to

be. So, it's going to change that after we muck

with it. That's one of the ways these different objects

manage each other is they're constantly evaluating what

it thinks that they should be versus what they really

are. If we went in and mucked around with stuff, it would

change that. Let's go back to that logs command for a

second

just to reiterate some of the features.

Like Docker logs, this has other options like --tail and

--follow. We can do that as well...tail

1, which basically says only give me

the last line and that's good in case you have

huge amounts of logs, right.

If you have production systems, these things, based on your

settings, will have a large amount of logs on the host

where the container is running.

You may not want to stream all that over the network to

your local shell in case you're on a multi-node

setup. By tail 1, I'm saying only

return the last and then

follow lets me stay streaming

for any future logs.

There we go. You'll notice there it said found three pods

using this pod.

That's a limitation. Again, I mentioned that earlier that

logs command can only see one pod at a time.

It's thinking that in a deployment,

they're all the same. I'm just going to pick one, and I'm

going to give it back to you.

You can specify each pod directly.

You would have to go and do a get pods command

to see the list of them.

Then, pull the exact name of them because they're not named

just pingpong. They're named pingpong with that extra ID on

them. You'd have to specify that if you wanted to look at a

specific pod.
