All right. Up next is this exercise here.

Before we do this, we need to get into

shpod. Remember, back at the beginning of this course, I

talked about this shpod container

that you can install on your cluster, and then it'll allow

you to attach into that container and essentially

get a shell in your cluster.

If you're not running on a Linux host

where you have direct access to these cluster IP's like

the one we just created while ago, then you're going to

need to be in the cluster so that you can route to

that IP address that we gave to the service we

just created for httpenv.

All right. We've got a couple of commands at the bottom

here. You see we're going to run those commands, but they

won't work if you're on Mac or Windows, or if

it's a remote Kubernetes deployment because we only created

that clusterIP service.

Remember, one of the rules of clusterIP is that it's only

available inside the cluster.

First, we need to essentially run the apply

command, which will create a couple of resources.

You can take a look at those by cURLing out, or just

putting that URL in the browser, the

bret.run/shpod.yml.

You can put that in your browser and you can see the clear

text of what it's about to do.

This is something you should always do no matter what

you're running on a system. If you're running untrusted

code, and you know, my code, I would definitely consider

untrusted.

You want to look at that to make sure that it's not going

to run anything nefarious and you know what it's doing.

I would recommend first, if you haven't run shpod

before yet, because maybe you've had all these utilities

locally on your system, then go ahead real quick.

Take a look at the YAML.

It's maybe 50 lines.

It's nothing fancy, but it's running a container.

It's giving it some authorization to essentially be root

inside your cluster.

That allows us to run kubectl l and all these other

utilities inside a container,

and also connect to the clusterIP, which we're

about to do.

First, we need to do the apply command.

We'll talk more about apply later.

bret.run/shpod.yml.

All right. Then we're going to attach into that container,

which will give us a new prompt inside our cluster.

We're going to attach in a specific namespace where

our shpod was created.

We're going to get it or ti.

It doesn't really matter the order of those options.

Then the shpod.

All right, now I'm in the shell.

You can actually tell that you're going to be into that

shell because you'll get a different colorful prompt that

gives you the IP address of the container you're in, as

well as what user you're acting at, and the name

of the pod there. We're not going to exit.

I'm just going to do a clear to get the screen.

Like so.

Now, we're going to run the three commands for

this example.

Let's go back to the slide real quick

just to make sure we know what we're doing.

All right. This first line is technically

something we don't have to do. You could simply copy and

paste the IP address from

kubectl get services.

We did that in the last lecture, a couple lectures ago

actually. We could just copy and paste that.

But, this is an example of how you can use the

kubectl command line programmatically.

This is a pretty simple, contrived example, but it does

have a couple of key points here.

What we're doing is we're setting an environment variable

IP inside our shell to the output

of a particular kubectl get command.

You can see here that we're getting a service named

httpenv. We're asking for the output to use

a Go template.

If you're not savvy with the Go programing language, that's

totally fine. This is similar to what Docker

can do as well, because both Kubernetes and Docker are

developing the Go language.

The Go language has a natural templating system inside

it that we're going to use here.

It's a little bit unfamiliar to you I'm sure if you haven't

used Go before, but that's OK.

This is just an example to get you started.

What we're saying is output using a Go template,

and the template is in this format, and

it's asking for us to go into the spec, and pull out the

clusterIP for this service, and then spit

it back out on the screen.

Next, we're going to cURL that, URL so that we can get a

response from our clusterIP.

That's the whole reason we're here, right, is to just check

out this sample service and see what we get back.

All right. IP, which is the environment variable we're

going to use, and dollar sign with the kubectl

command. The kubectl command will spit its

output and essentially dump it into this environment

variable. So, kubectl get service.

You can spell it out or use the abbreviation httpenv,

which is the name of the service we just created a few

lectures ago. Then we want the output to be in Go

template format.

We want our template to be

'{{ (or mustache) .spec.clusterIP.

And then end the template and then end

the parentheses.

Now, I should be able to echo $IP

and get back that IP address. So, great.

That's what we're looking for. Again, we could've just cut

and pasted it, but this allows us to see a simple one line

for getting an enviroment variable.

Now let's do the cURL. curl http.

We're going to use the $IP address because your clusterIP

will likely be different than mine.

Then we know that our application is listening on quadruple

8s.

You'll see that it should return back all the

environment variables, which is the whole purpose of that

container. Remember, I talked about the httpenv

essentially just dumping in a JSON array,

all the environment variables it sees in its application.

One of the things you can see here is the hostname.

The hostname would be different for each container

in the pod because we asked it to deploy 10 pods.

We're going to be able to just run this over and over

again. You can see on the second one, it's

technically different there.

We have a slightly different hostname.

We can use the jq command, which we've seen before.

We can do a curl/s http $IP:8888 like

we did before. Then we can pipe it, which means pass

the output into the jq command and say

we want to see hostname.

So, we could do that. If we just hit the up arrow, ran it

several times, you would notice that we're getting

different container hostnames each time.

That's because our clusterIP is round robin rotating,

by default, through the different pods in

order to get to our containers.

Then once it hits the 10, it'll go back and start them over

again from beginning. For now, if you want to exit this

container, just hit exit.

Remember, if you want to, you can clean up by

using the kubectl delete in the same way that

you use the kubectl apply.

Hit the up arrow to apply, back up,

and just type delete.

It will delete all those resources it created for our

shpod.
