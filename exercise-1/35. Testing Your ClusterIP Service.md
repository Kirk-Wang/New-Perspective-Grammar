All right. Up next is this exercise here.

好吧。接下来是这个练习。

Before we do this, we need to get into

shpod. Remember, back at the beginning of this course, I

talked about this shpod container

that you can install on your cluster, and then it'll allow

you to attach into that container and essentially

get a shell in your cluster.

在此之前，我们需要进入shpod。
记住，在本课程开始时，
我讨论过这个 shpod 容器，
您可以将它安装在集群上，
然后它将允许您附加到该容器中，
并在集群中获得一个 shell。
* at the beginning of在…初

If you're not running on a Linux host

where you have direct access to these cluster IP's like

the one we just created while ago, then you're going to

need to be in the cluster so that you can route to

that IP address that we gave to the service we

just created for httpenv.

如果您没有在 Linux 主机上运行，
而您可以直接访问这些集群 IP，
就像我们刚才创建的集群 IP 一样，
那么您需要在集群中，
以便您可以路由到我们为 httpenv 创建的服务
提供的 IP 地址。
* give to 提供

All right. We've got a couple of commands at the bottom

here. You see we're going to run those commands, but they

won't work if you're on Mac or Windows, or if

it's a remote Kubernetes deployment because we only created

that clusterIP service.

好吧。我们在底部这里有几个命令。

我们将运行这些命令，
但如果你在 Mac 或 Windows 上，
或者是远程 Kubernetes 部署，
这些命令将不起作用，
因为我们只创建了 clusterIP 服务。

Remember, one of the rules of clusterIP is that it's only

available inside the cluster.

记住，clusterIP 的规则之一是它只在集群中可用。

First, we need to essentially run the apply

command, which will create a couple of resources.

首先，我们需要运行 apply 命令，这将创建一些资源。

You can take a look at those by cURLing out, or just

putting that URL in the browser, the

bret.run/shpod.yml.

你可以通过 cURLing 或者把那个网址放进浏览器来查看它们，bret.run/shpod.yml。

You can put that in your browser and you can see the clear

text of what it's about to do.

你可以把它放到你的浏览器中，你可以看到它将要做什么的清晰文本。

This is something you should always do no matter what

you're running on a system. If you're running untrusted

code, and you know, my code, I would definitely consider

untrusted.

不管你在系统上运行什么，
这都是你应该一直做的事情。
如果你运行的是不可信的代码，
你知道，
我的代码，
我肯定会认为不可信。
* no matter what 不管…;无论…; 不管怎样;无论如何

You want to look at that to make sure that it's not going

to run anything nefarious and you know what it's doing.

你想看看它，以确保它不会运行任何邪恶的东西，你知道它在做什么。
* make sure that 一定要;设法保证; 查明;核实;弄清
* nefarious adj.罪恶的;不道德的

I would recommend first, if you haven't run shpod

before yet, because maybe you've had all these utilities

locally on your system, then go ahead real quick.

我建议您首先，
如果您之前还没有运行shpod，
因为您的系统中可能已经有了所有这些实用程序，
那么请快速进行。

Take a look at the YAML.

看一看这个 YAML。
* Take a look at看一看; 览

It's maybe 50 lines.

大概有50行。

It's nothing fancy, but it's running a container.

这没什么奇怪的，但它在运行一个容器。

It's giving it some authorization to essentially be root

inside your cluster.

它给予它一定的授权，使其实际上可以在您的集群中成为根用户。

That allows us to run kubectl l and all these other

utilities inside a container,

and also connect to the clusterIP, which we're

about to do.

这允许我们在一个容器中运行 kubectl 和所有其他实用程序，
还可以连接到 clusterIP，
这正是我们将要做的。

First, we need to do the apply command.

首先，我们需要执行 apply 命令。

We'll talk more about apply later.

我们稍后会讨论 apply。

bret.run/shpod.yml.

All right. Then we're going to attach into that container,

which will give us a new prompt inside our cluster.

好吧。然后我们将附加到容器中，这将在集群中给我们一个新的提示。

We're going to attach in a specific namespace where

our shpod was created.

我们将附加在创建 shpod 的特定名称空间中。

We're going to get it or ti.

要么得到它，要么得到ti。

It doesn't really matter the order of those options.

这些选项的顺序并不重要。

Then the shpod.

然后这个 shpod

All right, now I'm in the shell.

好吧，现在我在 shell 里了。

You can actually tell that you're going to be into that

shell because you'll get a different colorful prompt that

gives you the IP address of the container you're in, as

well as what user you're acting at, and the name

of the pod there. We're not going to exit.


实际上，您可以知道您将进入该shell，
因为您将得到一个不同的彩色提示，
该提示提供您所在容器的IP地址，
以及您所使用的用户和 pod 的名称。
我们不会退出。

I'm just going to do a clear to get the screen.

我将做一个清除屏幕的操作，

Like so.

就像这样

Now, we're going to run the three commands for

this example.

现在，我们将运行本例中的三个命令。

Let's go back to the slide real quick

just to make sure we know what we're doing.

让我们快速回到这张幻灯片确保我们知道我们在做什么。

All right. This first line is technically

something we don't have to do. You could simply copy and

paste the IP address from

kubectl get services.

好吧。从技术上讲，第一行是我们不需要做的。
您可以简单地复制和粘贴来自
kubectl get services
的 IP 地址。

We did that in the last lecture, a couple lectures ago

actually. We could just copy and paste that.

我们在上节课上做过，实际上是几节课之前。我们可以复制粘贴。

But, this is an example of how you can use the

kubectl command line programmatically.

但是，这是一个如何以编程方式使用 kubectl 命令行的示例。

This is a pretty simple, contrived example, but it does

have a couple of key points here.

这是一个相当简单的，人为的例子，但它确实有几个关键点。
* contrived adj.预谋的;不自然的;人为的;矫揉造作的;做作的

What we're doing is we're setting an environment variable

IP inside our shell to the output

of a particular kubectl get command.

我们要做的是在 shell 中设置一个环境变量 IP，
以输出特定的 kubectl get 命令。

You can see here that we're getting a service named

httpenv. We're asking for the output to use

a Go template.

你可以看到我们得到了一个叫 httpenv 的服务。我们要求输出使用 Go 模板。

If you're not savvy with the Go programing language, that's

totally fine. This is similar to what Docker

can do as well, because both Kubernetes and Docker are

developing the Go language.

如果你不精通 Go 编程语言，那完全可以。
这类似于 Docker 也可以做的事情，
因为 Kubernetes 和 Docker 都在用 Go 语言开发。

The Go language has a natural templating system inside

it that we're going to use here.

Go语言内部有一个自然的模板系统，我们将在这里使用它。

It's a little bit unfamiliar to you I'm sure if you haven't

used Go before, but that's OK.

您可能有点不熟悉，我确定您以前没有使用过 Go，但这没关系。
* a little bit一点
* unfamiliar adj.陌生的;不熟悉的;不认识的;无…的知识(或经验)

This is just an example to get you started.

这只是一个入门的例子

What we're saying is output using a Go template,

and the template is in this format, and

it's asking for us to go into the spec, and pull out the

clusterIP for this service, and then spit

it back out on the screen.

我们所说的是使用 Go 模板输出的，并且模板采用这种格式，
它要求我们进入 spec，并取出用于该服务的 clusterIP，
然后将其吐回到屏幕上。
* spit out 吐出
* spit it out vt. 痛痛快快地讲出来

Next, we're going to cURL that, URL so that we can get a

response from our clusterIP.

接下来，我们要 cURL 那个URL，这样我们就能从 clusterIP 中得到响应。

That's the whole reason we're here, right, is to just check

out this sample service and see what we get back.

这就是我们来这里的全部原因，
对吧，就是为了看看这个样本服务，
看看我们能得到什么。

All right. IP, which is the environment variable we're

going to use, and dollar sign with the kubectl

command. The kubectl command will spit its

output and essentially dump it into this environment

variable. So, kubectl get service.

好吧。IP 是我们要使用的环境变量，
用 kubectl 命令加上美元符号。
kubectl 命令将输出结果，
并将其转储到这个环境变量中。
所以，kubectl get service。

You can spell it out or use the abbreviation httpenv,

which is the name of the service we just created a few

lectures ago. Then we want the output to be in Go

template format.

We want our template to be

'{{ (or mustache) .spec.clusterIP.

And then end the template and then end

the parentheses.

Now, I should be able to echo $IP

and get back that IP address. So, great.

That's what we're looking for. Again, we could've just cut

and pasted it, but this allows us to see a simple one line

for getting an enviroment variable.

Now let's do the cURL. curl http.

We're going to use the $IP address because your clusterIP

will likely be different than mine.

Then we know that our application is listening on quadruple

8s.

You'll see that it should return back all the

environment variables, which is the whole purpose of that

container. Remember, I talked about the httpenv

essentially just dumping in a JSON array,

all the environment variables it sees in its application.

One of the things you can see here is the hostname.

The hostname would be different for each container

in the pod because we asked it to deploy 10 pods.

We're going to be able to just run this over and over

again. You can see on the second one, it's

technically different there.

We have a slightly different hostname.

We can use the jq command, which we've seen before.

We can do a curl/s http $IP:8888 like

we did before. Then we can pipe it, which means pass

the output into the jq command and say

we want to see hostname.

So, we could do that. If we just hit the up arrow, ran it

several times, you would notice that we're getting

different container hostnames each time.

That's because our clusterIP is round robin rotating,

by default, through the different pods in

order to get to our containers.

Then once it hits the 10, it'll go back and start them over

again from beginning. For now, if you want to exit this

container, just hit exit.

Remember, if you want to, you can clean up by

using the kubectl delete in the same way that

you use the kubectl apply.

Hit the up arrow to apply, back up,

and just type delete.

It will delete all those resources it created for our

shpod.
