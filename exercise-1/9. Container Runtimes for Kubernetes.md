Now. You've heard me talk about these container runtimes,

and maybe Docker, or maybe one of

the other options. You might want to ask, do we need Docker

at all? Right. Why are we talking about Docker if it's

optional?

Well, like I said, Kubernetes definitely needs a container

runtime, but it doesn't have to be Docker.

For the longest time now, Kubernetes has

been using Docker largely by default.

Different distributions will use it by default.

Obviously, Docker's tooling uses Docker Engine by default.

That was because Docker was first, and it

is generally the easiest and most well supported.

It's got the longest production history of every one of

them, so it tends to be the most stable.

But, we can choose others.

If you've been around a while, you might have heard

something called Rocket.

Unfortunately, Rocket is no longer supported.

CoreOS was bought by RedHat, and

they're working on a different project.

So, they didn't really need two.

So, they kind of got rid of Rocket.

It's still around, but it's no longer supported in

the latest versions of Kubernetes. One other option,

instead of using Docker, is to use containerd, which

is technically still largely maintained by Docker. It's actually

the underpinnings in Docker Engine. So, if you ever go

looking around a system running Docker, you'll find

containerd already running there because Docker today,

the Docker Engine, pulled out a

lot of its guts, put it into containerd, and then gave that

away to the community as a nice, leaner

runtime. Then, you have another option that's popular

in the RedHat community for cri-o, C R I - O.

That's largely maintained by RedHat and the rest of their

community.

These two, different options for Docker

aren't necessarily better for you as

a user. They're mostly designed to be

minimal functionality backends

that let Kubernetes do a lot of the work.

Now, containerd does work in more distributions

right now. It does have its own command line built in

and cri-o is definitely more focused on

just being a minimum runtime free to use with Kubernetes.

In fact, the idea with cri-o is that you're never

interfacing with it directly.

If you want to do anything with a container, you have to go

through Kubernetes to do it, unless you're really doing

some troubleshooting. But, a counter argument to that is

that yes, there are still plenty of times you're going to

want Docker. In fact, I will have Docker

as my engine in this course.

You don't have to do that. Not every distribution will have

Docker as its engine. You don't have to do that for

this course. But, I will assume that you have Docker

underneath. So, if we ever do anything with Docker, which

is probably rare, we will be doing it there.

Now, Docker does things like build the images, push

and pull the images.

Lots of other functionality and feature set over years of

Docker that's just not built into containerd or cri-o.

So, if you choose one of those other ones, realize that

it's a give or take. You're giving up functionality and

convenience, and possibly ease of troubleshooting,

especially when you're someone who knows Docker command

line well and you know how to use it in a pinch.

You're giving that up for maybe a smaller

binary, maybe a little bit of RAM or CPU back.

At this point, I'd say we're largely in an experimental

phase where most people are still choosing Docker

because they just know it.

They know how to troubleshoot it.

They know how to find the logs and all that other stuff

with the Docker engine.

What if we look out into the future?

Well, in our development environments, we yes,

will probably use Docker.

CI Pipelines, I would've said a couple of years ago that

you're probably using Docker, but we're starting to see

other tools that might make it a little easier in CI,

like Buildah from RedHat.

But, we're starting to see other tools in the community

that allow us to make it easier for building as a separate

tool than the engine itself.

But, a lot of this is experimentation and projects that

certainly have some interest, but aren't a majority of

people using it. I like to stick with what the majority

of people are using with Kubernetes because, you know,

honestly, it's hard enough without making decisions

around using tools that not everybody else is using.

So, I tend to stick with Docker.
