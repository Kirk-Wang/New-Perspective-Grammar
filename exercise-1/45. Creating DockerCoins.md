All right. Let's get this thing started.

好吧。让我们开始吧。

We're going to first create the deployment for redis.

我们将首先为redis创建部署。

That's a nice and easy one.

这是一个又好又简单的方法。

Then we're going to create the other four, using a specific

image with the tag v0.1.

然后我们将创建另外四个，使用带有标记 v0.1 的特定 image。

That's going to give us the first version.

这将给我们第一个版本。

We'll do other things later with newer versions

to do things like updates.

我们稍后会用更新的版本来做其他的事情，比如更新。

kubectl create deployment redis

--image=redis.

We don't really care about the version, so it'll do that.

我们并不真的在乎版本，所以会这么做。

Remember, these are happening in the background.

请记住，这些是在后台发生的。

They're being downloaded and run in the background

without us having to wait for them to finish like a docker

run command. I'm going to keep typing and

don't necessarily copy and paste these.

它们被下载并在后台运行，
而我们不必像 docker run 命令那样等待它们完成。
我要继续打字，不一定要复制粘贴这些。

Use this as an opportunity for muscle memory so that you

get these commands ingrained in that brain.

利用这一点作为肌肉记忆的机会，让这些命令在大脑中根深蒂固。
* opportunity n. 时机，机会
* ingrained adj. 根深蒂固的；彻头彻尾的；生染的

kubectl create. Notice we're using create now,

not run, because we want to be very explicit about all

our future commands.

注意，我们现在使用的是 create，而不是 run，因为我们希望对所有未来的命令都非常明确。
* explicit about 对…态度鲜明，对…明确表示

...deployment hasher --image=dockercoins/hasher:v0.1.

I'm just going to hit the up arrow.

我只要敲击向上的箭头。

I'm going to cheat a little bit.

我要稍微作弊一下。

rng. Then change the name, rng.

rng。然后改名字，rng。

Then, I'm going to change those names to webui.

然后，我要把这些名字改成 webui。

The last one, worker.

最后一个，worker。

Again, we designed this app so that it can come up in any

order.

同样，我们设计了此应用程序，以便可以按任何顺序启动它。

All that means is if the application can't find

the parts it needs to find, it's going to either

go...depending on the application, will either go into

a retry state, or it might crash and Kubernetes

will just recreate it.

所有这一切意味着，如果应用程序找不到它需要找到的部分，
它要么进…取决于应用程序，
要么进入重试状态，要么它可能崩溃，Kubernetes 只会重新创建它。

Let's go check to see if it's actually started.

我们去看看是不是真的启动了。

We're going to do a kubectl logs command.

我们要执行 kubectl logs 命令。

Remember, because there's limits to logs, we could use

Stern right here, but we only need to get the one container

because we're only launching one pod with, one container,

in these deployments.

请记住，由于日志有限制，因此我们可以在此处使用 Stern，
但是我们只需要获得一个容器，
因为在这些部署中，我们仅使用一个容器启动一个 Pod。

So, the regular logs command will be fine.

因此，常规的 logs 命令会很好。

We're going to do kubectl logs deploy

rng. Remember, we can use the short command, deploy.

We don't have to type deployment.

All right. That looks like it's running. It says it's good.

Let's do deploy/worker.

It looks like we're there

in a wait state. It says waiting 10 seconds and restarting.

So, it's crashing.

What could be wrong here?

Any guesses? Maybe not the rng.

It's the worker that's the problem.

We need to expose, right.

We mentioned a while ago the exposes.

So, let's go through exposing the right services so they

can communicate. Because right now, they're all looking for

the names, and those DNS names don't exist on the network.

All right. For three of these, we're going to need to give

them a service so they have a steady, reliable DNS

endpoint for us to access them through.

That's the redis, rng and hasher.

Remember that the webui we're going to deal with in a

minute, and with the worker, it

doesn't need any incoming connection.

So, there's no reason for it to have a service.

All right, let's do a kubectl expose

deployment redis,

and we need to specify the port on redis

that it's listening on.

That's 6379.

Then we're going to do the same thing, kubectl expose

deployment,

and rng of Port 80.

Then, I'm going to hit the up arrow for Port 80, and

the hasher.

All right. We got those three exposed.

Let's go check out that worker log real quick.

kubectl logs deploy worker.

This time, we're going to follow it.

We'll just sit here until it's healthy.

All right. There we go. Now, it's no longer in a wait state,

and it's saying it's getting work.

See how it says there are four units of work done?

So, we know it's able to work its way through the process.

See the work and put it into redis.

Nice. Found some coins.
