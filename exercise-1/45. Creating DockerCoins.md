All right. Let's get this thing started.

We're going to first create the deployment for redis.

That's a nice and easy one.

Then we're going to create the other four, using a specific

image with the tag v0.1.

That's going to give us the first version.

We'll do other things later with newer versions

to do things like updates.

kubectl create deployment redis

--image=redis.

We don't really care about the version, so it'll do that.

Remember, these are happening in the background.

They're being downloaded and run in the background

without us having to wait for them to finish like a docker

run command. I'm going to keep typing and

don't necessarily copy and paste these.

Use this as an opportunity for muscle memory so that you

get these commands ingrained in that brain.

kubectl create. Notice we're using create now,

not run, because we want to be very explicit about all

our future commands.

...deployment hasher --image=dockercoins/hasher:v0.1.

I'm just going to hit the up arrow.

I'm going to cheat a little bit.

rng. Then change the name, rng.

Then, I'm going to change those names to webui.

The last one, worker.

Again, we designed this app so that it can come up in any

order.

All that means is if the application can't find

the parts it needs to find, it's going to either

go...depending on the application, will either go into

a retry state, or it might crash and Kubernetes

will just recreate it.

Let's go check to see if it's actually started.

We're going to do a kubectl logs command.

Remember, because there's limits to logs, we could use

Stern right here, but we only need to get the one container

because we're only launching one pod with, one container,

in these deployments.

So, the regular logs command will be fine.

We're going to do kubectl logs deploy

rng. Remember, we can use the short command, deploy.

We don't have to type deployment.

All right. That looks like it's running. It says it's good.

Let's do deploy/worker.

It looks like we're there

in a wait state. It says waiting 10 seconds and restarting.

So, it's crashing.

What could be wrong here?

Any guesses? Maybe not the rng.

It's the worker that's the problem.

We need to expose, right.

We mentioned a while ago the exposes.

So, let's go through exposing the right services so they

can communicate. Because right now, they're all looking for

the names, and those DNS names don't exist on the network.

All right. For three of these, we're going to need to give

them a service so they have a steady, reliable DNS

endpoint for us to access them through.

That's the redis, rng and hasher.

Remember that the webui we're going to deal with in a

minute, and with the worker, it

doesn't need any incoming connection.

So, there's no reason for it to have a service.

All right, let's do a kubectl expose

deployment redis,

and we need to specify the port on redis

that it's listening on.

That's 6379.

Then we're going to do the same thing, kubectl expose

deployment,

and rng of Port 80.

Then, I'm going to hit the up arrow for Port 80, and

the hasher.

All right. We got those three exposed.

Let's go check out that worker log real quick.

kubectl logs deploy worker.

This time, we're going to follow it.

We'll just sit here until it's healthy.

All right. There we go. Now, it's no longer in a wait state,

and it's saying it's getting work.

See how it says there are four units of work done?

So, we know it's able to work its way through the process.

See the work and put it into redis.

Nice. Found some coins.
