All right. We just had a video about Kubernetes

architecture. I did some scribbling on a screenshot.

好吧。我们刚刚有了一段关于 Kubernetes 架构的视频。
我在截图上乱涂了几笔。

We're going to go over that same thing again in a different

way, because it bears repeating that these are the

components that will make up every design,

of every cluster, you build.

我们将以不同的方式再次讨论同一件事，
因为值得重复的是，这些组件将构成您构建的每个集群的每个设计。
* go over 仔细检查; 认真讨论; 用心思考
* make up 和解;和好; 组成; 构成; 编造，虚构; 给…化妆; 为…打扮; 凑足，补齐; 补足，补上; 和解; 和好; 配; 铺; 搭

So, it's good to talk about them in different ways.

所以，用不同的方式来谈论它们是很好的。

So, here's a list, right.

所以，这里有一个清单，对吧。

We have on any single node, you're going to

have a container engine.

In this case, it's Docker.

在任何一个节点上，
你要有一个容器引擎。
在这种情况下，是 Docker。

You could have the different

container engines that Kubernetes supports.

您可以使用 Kubernetes 支持的不同容器引擎。

Right now, it's two other ones, cri-o and containerd.

现在，是另外两个，cri-o 和 containerd。

But, it doesn't really matter.

但是，这并不重要。

It just needs to be a container engine because Kubernetes

itself doesn't start your containers.

它只需要一个容器引擎，因为 Kubernetes 本身不会启动容器。

It needs that lower level component provided to it.

它需要提供给它的低层组件。

Then we have a kubelet agent on each node

that's taking orders and talking back and forth to the API.

然后我们在每个节点上有一个 kubelet 代理，它接受命令并与 API 来回通信。

Then we have the kube-proxy which receives orders

from the node agent and takes

action on the settings for networking on the local machine.

然后我们有一个 kube-proxy，
它接收来自节点代理的命令，
并对本地机器上的联网设置进行操作。

We'll talk more about that later as well.

我们稍后也会详细讨论。

Now, you might see in old documentation that these are

referred to as minions, but we're getting away from that.

现在，您可能会在旧文档中看到，这些被称为 minion ，但我们正在远离它。
* referred to as 被称为; 简称; 称作
* away from 离开

It's really nodes is the terminology we're using here.

实际上，node 是我们在这里使用的术语。
* terminology n.(某学科的)术语;有特别含义的用语;专门用语

When we talk about the masters, I

like to refer to it as the control plane because it may be

one or more master nodes, and

control plane refers to all those services that are in

control of the cluster.

当我们谈到主节点时，
我喜欢把它称为控制平面，
因为它可能是一个或多个主节点，
而控制平面是指所有控制集群的服务。
* in control of处于控制地位

We're really talking about a core set of services here.

Etcd Is that database.

We've got to have it.

我们在这里讨论的是一组核心服务。
Etcd 就是这个数据库。
我们必须拥有它。

The API server is the in and out point for

all communications. It's how all the tools, and the web

interfaces, and everything communicates to Kubernetes.

API 服务器是所有通信的输入和输出点。
所有的工具，网络接口，以及所有的东西都是如何与 Kubernetes 通信的。
* in and out 进进出出；来来去去; 短期清算；短线买卖
* point for 指向
* communication n.表达;交流;交际;传递;通信;交通联系;信息;书信;电话

Then we have the core services. Things like controller

manager, scheduler, and I mentioned

that CoreDNS. That's also something that you're going to be

seeing a lot of. It's not technically required, but we

might as well consider it required because we're going to

need DNS in just about every cluster we run.

我们有核心服务。比如控制器管理器、调度程序和我提到的 CoreDNS。
这也是你们会经常看到的。
这在技术上不是必需的，但我们也可以认为它是必需的，
因为我们几乎在每个运行的集群中都需要DNS。
* mention v.提到;写到;说到
* might as well 只好;也无妨; 和…一样
* consider v.(尤指为作出决定而)仔细考虑，细想;认为;以为;觉得;体谅;考虑到;顾及
* just about 勉强; 差一点就不; 差不多; 几乎; 近乎

Here's another way of looking at the layout of

how these parts fit together.

这是另一种查看这些部分如何组合在一起的布局方式。
* looking at 看; 考虑
* fit together 组合在一起

It's pretty cool here because the colors will differentiate

the type of protocols.

这里很酷，因为颜色会区分协议的类型。
* differentiate v. 区分;区别;辨别;表明…间的差别;构成…间差别的特征;(尤指不公正地)差别对待，区别对待

If you get really into networking protocols and how these

things are communicating, these colors will make a

difference. But, just notice that...realize

we've got technically at the bottom three nodes.

如果你真的进入了网络协议和这些东西是如何交流的，
这些颜色会有不同。但是，请注意…要意识到我们在技术上处于最后三个节点。
* make a difference 有影响
* realize v. 理解;领会;认识到;意识到;实现;将…变为现实;(所担心的事)发生，产生

Each one of those has networking components

like kube-proxy, possibly a different, additional

feature depending on how you set the networking.

We'll talk more about that later.

其中每一个都有网络组件，比如 kube-proxy，
可能是一个不同的附加功能，这取决于您设置网络的方式。
我们稍后再谈。
* Each one一一；各人
* depending on依据，根据

There's always going to be some sort of networking

component there. There's the kubelet agent, then there's

your Docker or other container runtime, and then the OS,

right. Usually Linux, maybe Windows.

Then again, up at the top, we're talking about the

etc database. That's a key value store.

That will be on one or more nodes, depending on whether you

need high availability.

Then you have the controller manager which

manages a bunch of controllers. We'll talk about

controllers later.

You've probably heard of some of them already, like

deployments and ReplicaSets. We'll get more into that.

Then the API server, you can see how everything's talking

through that API server in the middle.

The scheduler over there, on the side, on

the right side, is making decisions about

where things should go on which nodes.

All right. The interesting thing about Kubernetes, and also

may be part of this challenge, is that it's so flexible

in how you can design and deploy it that

you don't even have to run the control plane in containers.

You can run those separately on individual machines,

on the bare host. Or, you can run them all on one machine,

in containers, or a little bit of both.

You might run etcd on its own servers

and separate that database out into its own

replicated set of three or more servers for redundancy.

Then, bring the other components to separate

servers and maybe run them in containers.

It doesn't really matter.

It depends on your deployment tools.

What kind of features those deployment tools have for how

your design is going to lay out. Now, most of us that are

all using small clusters, we just use the defaults

that come with however our distribution wants to install

it. So, if you use something like Docker Enterprise,

it's going to want three servers for redundancy.

We'll talk more about etcd and how three is the minimum

you need for redundancy on your masters.

Then, it will push around the

different components to where it needs them based on their

design for how to make it stable and redundant.

You might see this sometimes called the multi-master setup,

which is what most of us are going to need in production.

We're going to need the HA, high availability

in production.

We are probably going to use different tools, and even

different distributions, for going into production

than we might use on a local machine.

For me, I'm going to be using Docker Desktop a lot because

Kubernetes is built in on my local machine, and it's nice

and easy. But, that doesn't work in production.

I would need a separate distribution, on separate

OS's to be able to install that, especially in a high

availability mode, which for Kubernetes can be lots of

work unless you're using a distribution tool that

will automate all that for you.

If you choose something like a cloud distribution,

an important note here is that part of what they're

offering you is that they're taking care of that

control plane for you. They're running the API and

managing the etc database.

So, in a lot of these cases, you don't even have

a view of that infrastructure and what it looks like.

They just tell you the API endpoint and give you

credentials. That makes it so much easier to

run with Kubernetes. In fact, as a consultant, when I'm

working with clients, I'm usually looking for reasons

to get them into a cloud Kubernetes like Google's

Kubernetes, or Amazon's, or Azure's, or Digital Ocean's.

Because that's going to save them so much more time, and

it's going to let the experts handle the logic

and the decisions around how the control plane runs.

For most of those, the only job you have left is to just

spin up some nodes, however big you want them to be, and

then run a command or two to connect them

to the cluster. Now they become nodes in

that cluster that's provided to you, at least the API,

right. So, it separates the concerns.

You manage your nodes, they manage the control plane.

That's how a lot of them work.
