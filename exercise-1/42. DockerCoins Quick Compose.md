Let's see this application in action

as if you were a developer running it on your local

machine. What we're going to you do here is use Compose.

让我们看一下该应用程序的运行情况，
就好像您是在本地计算机上运行它的开发人员一样。
我们在这里要做的就是使用 Compose。
* in action 在积极活动中，在活动；参加；在运行，在运转中；在起作用
* as if 好像…一样,仿佛,似乎; 好像,仿佛,似乎; 好像，仿佛，似乎

That's Docker Compose.

这就是 Docker Compose。

Nothing to do with Kubernetes, but it's going to allow us

to at least see, on a simple, single machine, what

this might look like for local development.

与 Kubernetes 无关，但它至少能让我们看到，
在一个简单的机器上，本地开发可能会是什么样子。
* Nothing to 比起……简直等于零

If you don't have Compose installed, that's fine.

如果你没有安装 Compose，那也没关系。

You can also use Play-with-Docker, which will give you a

full Docker node here.

你也可以使用 Play-with-Docker，它会给你一个完整的 Docker 节点。

I'm on play-with-docker.com.

我在 play-with-docker.com 上。

I've created an instance over here on the left, and

that gives me this prompt here. In either that, or on

my local shell, if you download this

Docker compose file in the first line with cURL.

我在左侧的这里创建了一个实例，这给了我提示。
无论是在那还是在我的本地 Shell 中，
如果您在第一行中使用 cURL 下载此 Docker compose 文件。

So again, if you're on Windows and you don't have cURL

installed locally, then you can either just go to that

URL and download the file as a Docker compose file or

you could just use Play-with-Docker.

同样，如果你在 Windows 上，并且没有在本地安装 cURL，
那么你可以直接转到那个 URL 并下载这个文件
作为 Docker compose 文件，或者你直接使用 Play-with-Docker。

This is something we're only going to do for a quick

second. Just the check that this app works and what it

looks like.

这只是我们很快要做的事情。
只需检查该应用程序是否正常运行，以及它的外观即可。

It's not so important that you set up a new environment

just for this. We're here for Kubernetes, but

we do want to see what this app looks like in its very

simplest form. This one, I'm going to use Play-with-Docker

since I've already got that spun up here.

为此设置一个新环境并不是那么重要。
我们来这里是为了 Kubernetes，
但我们确实想看看这个应用程序最简单的形式是什么样的。
这个，我将使用 Play-with-Docker 
因为我已经在这里旋转了。

I'm just going to copy this cURL line over,

download and save the DockerCoins compose file.

我要复制这条 cURL，下载并保存 DockerCoins compose 文件。

All right. Then, I'm going to run docker compose

up, which you might use for local development.

好吧。然后，我将运行 docker compose up，您可以使用它进行本地开发。

Here we go. docker compose up and that's going to download

a bunch of stuff in the background.

我们开始吧。docker compose up 并且它会在后台下载一些东西。

While that's happening,

I'm going to just open up this compose file so you can see

what it looks like.

在此过程中，我将打开这个 compose 文件，这样您就可以看到它是什么样子的。

I'm going to pull up a new tab.

我要打开一个新 tab。

While Docker Compose is downloading those images and

starting up the containers, let me just show you the

compose file so you can see how simple it is to start with.

在 Docker Compose 下载这些镜像并启动容器的同时，
让我向您展示 Compose 文件，以便您了解开始的过程非常简单。
* start with 以…开始

This might be what we would use on a local machine.

这可能是我们在本地机器上使用的。

This has a version 2 file, but that's not really

very important here. What you can see is there's five

services and they're all using different images.

这是一个版本2的文件，但在这里不是很重要。
你能看到的是有五个服务，它们都使用不同的镜像。

Redis is just using the standard Redis image from

DockerHub. The other four are using

images from our DockerCoins user on DockerHub.

Redis 只是使用来自 DockerHub 的标准 Redis image。
另外四个是使用来自 DockerCoins 用户在 DockerHub 上的 image。

We'll talk a little bit more about that and versions later.

我们稍后会详细讨论它和它的版本。

You'll see that the webui is the only one that has a public

port because we need to get to it as the administrator.

您将看到 webui 是唯一具有公共端口的，
因为我们需要以管理员的身份访问它。

All right. Let's go see how our Docker Compose is doing.

好吧。让我们来看看我们的 Docker Compose 是如何做的。

You can see that it's doing a bunch of logs.

你可以看到它在做一堆日志。

It's writing a ton to logs because that's its job.

它要写大量的日志，因为这是它的工作。

Every action is going to have a log, and the

colors on the left are the different parts of the service.

每个操作都有一个日志，左边的颜色是服务的不同部分。

They're actually reliable enough that if they fail, they're

just going to restart.

它们确实足够可靠，如果它们失败了，它们就会重新启动。

They will sit there and wait until all the services are up

so that it can start.

他们会坐在那里等着，直到所有的服务都启动了，这样就可以开始了。

You'll notice that on Play-with-Docker, you get

a port, for this is the public port, the 8000 here as you

see in the middle. If I click on that, it should open

up a new tab with our wonderful

Web performance dashboard.

你会注意到在 Play-with-Docker 中，
你有一个端口，这是公共端口，8000 在这里，正如你中间所看到的。
如果我点击它，它会打开一个新的标签页，
里面有我们出色的 Web 性能仪表盘。

Not really wonderful because it kind of tends to just give

you either four or zero.

不是很好因为它倾向于只给你 4 或者 0。

What we're looking for here is four.

这里我们要找的是四。

The number 4. 4.0 exactly.

数字 4。精确到 4.0。

This has to do with the fact that our polling

isn't always in sync with the redis updates.

这与以下事实有关：我们的轮询并不总是与 Redis 更新同步。

Basically, when it's polling every second through the

webui, it's either getting a return of nothing's

changed or we've had four things.

基本上，当它通过 webui 每秒钟进行一次轮询时，
要么得到一个什么都没有改变的返回，
要么我们得到了四个东西。

The point here is that we're getting an average of four.

We're peaking at four per second

roughly. If you kind of look up here on the left, you can

see the number 4 and the very top left there.

这里的关键是我们得到的平均值是 4。
峰值大概是每秒 4 次。
如果你看左边这里，
你可以看到数字 4，最左上角。

So, our job is to have that go through

the roof. We're mining, right.

所以，我们的工作就是让它穿过屋顶。我们在采矿，对吧。
* go through the roof 怒气冲天;大发雷霆;暴跳如雷; 猛增，飞涨

So, we want to use the resources as much as we can.

所以，我们要尽可能多地利用资源。

We're going to try to deploy this to Kubernetes.

我们将试着把它部署到 Kubernetes。

We'll start to see how we can scale this up to get

better performance out of it.

Like I said, we're not great at

this web interface stuff, so don't worry and stress about

the 4 versus 0 stuff.

We're just looking for averages there.

This is maybe some information you might care about if

you're a web geek.

Jerome built this again many years ago.

You can go look at the source code, if you'd like, from the

links in this section.

That's all we're going to do with Compose.

That's really it. We just wanted to see what it would look

like on a single machine, with a simple compose file,

before we jump into doing it on

Kubernetes. Go ahead and either do a docker compose down,

or if you are in Play-with-Docker, go

ahead and just click that little close session.

I'll go do that now, and we'll

see it shut down that container. Then we can close our

browser.
