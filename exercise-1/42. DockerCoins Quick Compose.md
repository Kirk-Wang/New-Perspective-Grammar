Let's see this application in action

as if you were a developer running it on your local

machine. What we're going to you do here is use Compose.

That's Docker Compose.

Nothing to do with Kubernetes, but it's going to allow us

to at least see, on a simple, single machine, what

this might look like for local development.

If you don't have Compose installed, that's fine.

You can also use Play-with-Docker, which will give you a

full Docker node here.

I'm on play-with-docker.com.

I've created an instance over here on the left, and

that gives me this prompt here. In either that, or on

my local shell, if you download this

Docker compose file in the first line with cURL.

So again, if you're on Windows and you don't have cURL

installed locally, then you can either just go to that

URL and download the file as a Docker compose file or

you could just use Play-with-Docker.

This is something we're only going to do for a quick

second. Just the check that this app works and what it

looks like.

It's not so important that you set up a new environment

just for this. We're here for Kubernetes, but

we do want to see what this app looks like in its very

simplest form. This one, I'm going to use Play-with-Docker

since I've already got that spun up here.

I'm just going to copy this cURL line over,

download and save the DockerCoins compose file.

All right. Then, I'm going to run docker compose

up, which you might use for local development.

Here we go. docker compose up and that's going to download

a bunch of stuff in the background.

While that's happening,

I'm going to just open up this compose file so you can see

what it looks like.

I'm going to pull up a new tab.

While Docker Compose is downloading those images and

starting up the containers, let me just show you the

compose file so you can see how simple it is to start with.

This might be what we would use on a local machine.

This has a version 2 file, but that's not really

very important here. What you can see is there's five

services and they're all using different images.

Redis is just using the standard Redis image from

DockerHub. The other four are using

images from our DockerCoins user on DockerHub.

We'll talk a little bit more about that and versions later.

You'll see that the webui is the only one that has a public

port because we need to get to it as the administrator.

All right. Let's go see how our Docker Compose is doing.

You can see that it's doing a bunch of logs.

It's writing a ton to logs because that's its job.

Every action is going to have a log, and the

colors on the left are the different parts of the service.

They're actually reliable enough that if they fail, they're

just going to restart.

They will sit there and wait until all the services are up

so that it can start.

You'll notice that on Play-with-Docker, you get

a port, for this is the public port, the 8000 here as you

see in the middle. If I click on that, it should open

up a new tab with our wonderful

Web performance dashboard.

Not really wonderful because it kind of tends to just give

you either four or zero.

What we're looking for here is four.

The number 4. 4.0 exactly.

This has to do with the fact that our polling

isn't always in sync with the redis updates.

Basically, when it's polling every second through the

webui, it's either getting a return of nothing's

changed or we've had four things.

The point here is that we're getting an average of four.

We're peaking at four per second

roughly. If you kind of look up here on the left, you can

see the number 4 and the very top left there.

So, our job is to have that go through

the roof. We're mining, right.

So, we want to use the resources as much as we can.

We're going to try to deploy this to Kubernetes.

We'll start to see how we can scale this up to get

better performance out of it.

Like I said, we're not great at

this web interface stuff, so don't worry and stress about

the 4 versus 0 stuff.

We're just looking for averages there.

This is maybe some information you might care about if

you're a web geek.

Jerome built this again many years ago.

You can go look at the source code, if you'd like, from the

links in this section.

That's all we're going to do with Compose.

That's really it. We just wanted to see what it would look

like on a single machine, with a simple compose file,

before we jump into doing it on

Kubernetes. Go ahead and either do a docker compose down,

or if you are in Play-with-Docker, go

ahead and just click that little close session.

I'll go do that now, and we'll

see it shut down that container. Then we can close our

browser.
