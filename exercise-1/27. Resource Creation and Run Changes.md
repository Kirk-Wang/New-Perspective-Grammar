That's two times, at least in these lectures so

far, that you've seen a deprecation warning around

the run command. What's going on there?

到目前为止，
至少在这些讲座中，
已经有两次您在 run 命令周围
看到了一个 deprecation 警告。
怎么回事？

Why are we seeing that and why aren't we doing something

about it? Right now, in

2019, this actually started in 2018 and is probably going

to go through 2020, we are in a

phase of changing how the run command works.

为什么我们会看到这种情况，为什么我们不采取行动?
现在，在 2019 年，
这实际上开始于 2018 年，
可能会持续到 2020 年，
我们正处在一个改变运行命令工作方式的阶段。

The

goal is really to simplify the run command. Soon the

default, when you type kubectl run with something, it will

just create the pod.

目标是简化 run 命令。
很快默认情况下，当您键入 kubectl run with something 时，
它只会创建 pod。

It won't do what we did initially, which is where it

created deployment, that created ReplicaSet, that then

created pod. They're trying to change the

run command to now be much more simple like the Docker run

command. That's because there are newer

commands that are more explicit and what they're

trying to do. That's the kubectl create.

As you can see here, I can use kubectl create

to specify a deployment, a job or a cron

job specifically, so that I don't have to guess about

what exactly my run command is doing in the background,

right.

I appreciate and like the way they're taking this because

I think there was a little too much magic in the run command once

it got all of its features and generators.

It was a little tricky to figure out what it was doing in

the background. For those of us that are operators, we

cared more about that run command. So, we wanted to be more

literal, more explicit in what we were typing.

So, we would definitely be preferring these create

commands like you see here.

The run command, it was meant to always be just simpler

for starting something on your local machine for test

purposes. The run really isn't a

production command for most things. Because it's

doing this generation templating thing in the background,

and we're never really sure exactly what we're getting if

we type a specific command a certain way.

In fact, throughout this course, you will now see three,

different major types of managing resources, specifically

in creating them.

We have the kubectl run.

We now just learned about the kubectl create, which we'll

be using more. Then later, we're going to get into kubectl

apply, which is the most declarative way

to create resources.

kubectl apply only

allows a YAML file to be used.

It requires you to give it a file, which has in it a

descriptor of what you're trying to create, or change, or

delete. In fact, that's all done with the same kubectl

apply command, which is a little different than the

kubectl create command.

Clearly, when you're using create, you're creating

something. If you want to use kubectl update, which we'll

show later, or kubectl delete, we know what those commands

are doing. With apply, it's extremely

declarative, meaning that we don't know what it's

actually going to do. We just know that we are giving it a

state, and it's going to try to change everything to match

that state. We'll

get into these three, different types of ways of deploying and

managing resources later. But for now, just know that run

is changing. For now, it does what it does.

But, eventually, it's only going to create pods by default.
