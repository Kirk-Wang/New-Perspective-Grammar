That's two times, at least in these lectures so

far, that you've seen a deprecation warning around

the run command. What's going on there?

到目前为止，
至少在这些讲座中，
已经有两次您在 run 命令周围
看到了一个 deprecation 警告。
怎么回事？
* so far 到目前为止，迄今为止
* deprecation n. 祈免；贬低；反对

Why are we seeing that and why aren't we doing something

about it? Right now, in

2019, this actually started in 2018 and is probably going

to go through 2020, we are in a

phase of changing how the run command works.

为什么我们会看到这种情况，为什么我们不采取行动?
现在，在 2019 年，
这实际上开始于 2018 年，
可能会持续到 2020 年，
我们正处在一个改变运行命令工作方式的阶段。
* seeing that 既然;因为;鉴于
* Right now 现在;此时此刻
* go through 经历，经受; 翻阅;

The

goal is really to simplify the run command. Soon the

default, when you type kubectl run with something, it will

just create the pod.

目标是简化 run 命令。
很快默认情况下，当您键入 kubectl run with something 时，
它只会创建 pod。

It won't do what we did initially, which is where it

created deployment, that created ReplicaSet, that then

created pod. They're trying to change the

run command to now be much more simple like the Docker run

command. That's because there are newer

commands that are more explicit and what they're

trying to do. That's the kubectl create.

它不会做我们最初做的事，
那就是它创建 deployment，
创建 ReplicaSet，
然后创建 pod。
他们试图将 run 命令改为更简单的 Docker run 命令。
这是因为有更显式的新命令，以及它们要做的事情。
这就是 kubectl create。
* explicit adj.清楚明白的;易于理解的;(说话)清晰的，明确的;直言的;坦率的;直截了当的;不隐晦的;不含糊的

As you can see here, I can use kubectl create

to specify a deployment, a job or a cron

job specifically, so that I don't have to guess about

what exactly my run command is doing in the background,

right.

正如您在这里看到的，
我可以使用 kubectl create 
具体指定 deployment、job 或 cron job，
这样我就不必猜测 run 命令在后台到底在做什么，对吧。
* so that 因此; 以便
* specify v.具体说明;明确规定;详述;详列
* specifically adv.明确地;具体地;特意;专门地;具体来说;确切地说
* exactly adv. 恰好地；正是；精确地；正确地

I appreciate and like the way they're taking this because

I think there was a little too much magic in the run command once

it got all of its features and generators.

我欣赏并喜欢他们处理这个问题的方式，
因为我认为在 run 命令中有太多的魔力，
一旦它得到了所有的特性和生成器。
* appreciate v.欣赏;赏识;重视;感激;感谢;欢迎;理解;意识到;领会

It was a little tricky to figure out what it was doing in

the background. For those of us that are operators, we

cared more about that run command. So, we wanted to be more

literal, more explicit in what we were typing.

要弄清楚它在后台做什么有点难。
对于我们这些操作员来说，我们更关心运行命令。
所以，我们想要在我们输入的内容中更直白，更明确。
* tricky adj.难办的;难对付的;狡猾的;诡计多端的
* figure out 想出; 理解; 弄清
* literal adj. 文字的；逐字的；无夸张的
* explicit adj. 明确的；清楚的；直率的；详述的

So, we would definitely be preferring these create

commands like you see here.

所以，我们肯定更喜欢这些创建命令，就像你在这里看到的。
* definitely adv.肯定;没问题;当然;确实;确切地;明确地;清楚地
* preferring v.较喜欢;喜欢…多于…prefer的现在分词

The run command, it was meant to always be just simpler

for starting something on your local machine for test

purposes. The run really isn't a

production command for most things. Because it's

doing this generation templating thing in the background,

and we're never really sure exactly what we're getting if

we type a specific command a certain way.

run 命令的目的是为了更简单地在本地计算机上启动一些东西进行测试。
大多数情况下，run 并不是一个生产命令。
因为它在后台做这个生成模板的事情，
如果我们以某种方式输入一个特定的命令，
我们永远不知道我们会得到什么。
* specific command【计】专用命令
* exactly adv.精确地;准确地;确切地;

In fact, throughout this course, you will now see three,

different major types of managing resources, specifically

in creating them.

We have the kubectl run.

We now just learned about the kubectl create, which we'll

be using more. Then later, we're going to get into kubectl

apply, which is the most declarative way

to create resources.

kubectl apply only

allows a YAML file to be used.

It requires you to give it a file, which has in it a

descriptor of what you're trying to create, or change, or

delete. In fact, that's all done with the same kubectl

apply command, which is a little different than the

kubectl create command.

Clearly, when you're using create, you're creating

something. If you want to use kubectl update, which we'll

show later, or kubectl delete, we know what those commands

are doing. With apply, it's extremely

declarative, meaning that we don't know what it's

actually going to do. We just know that we are giving it a

state, and it's going to try to change everything to match

that state. We'll

get into these three, different types of ways of deploying and

managing resources later. But for now, just know that run

is changing. For now, it does what it does.

But, eventually, it's only going to create pods by default.
