Everybody should watch this video because it's going to

describe to you how you're going to set up your classroom

environment.

I know that there's lots of Web-based Kubernetes and Docker

experiences out there, and there's Web-based coding things.

But, I think that if you're seriously going to learn

Kubernetes, you need to know how to install it locally, and

you need to know how to install it on a server.

I mean, a real server.

Part of the thing of this course is teaching you

the various ways to install Kubernetes.

There's technically over 100 ways right now

to install Kubernetes, depending on your environment, and

your distribution, and your vendor and which cloud you're

in. There's just so many different ways to do it.

I'm going to give you three, main ways for installing

whether you're on Windows, Mac, old Windows, or Linux,

or the Cloud. Then I'm going to give you a browser option

as a backup. So, these four, different ways have

their own pros and cons, and it's up to you

to make a decision. You don't have to watch all the videos.

You just have to decide which OS you're on and which one

you're going to try first.

If that one doesn't seem to work out for you, come back

here to these installation videos.

You can look at the slides, you can click on the links

and try a different option if that fits you better.

Sometimes running locally can be easy,

but sometimes running locally can be hard if you don't have

enough resources.

Kubernetes is known for using a significant amount of CPU

and RAM even at idle.

There's a lot of things going on and it's not necessarily

as simple as running Docker locally.

So, you may not have all the memory, or the

battery power, to run Kubernetes on your own machine.

You may decide to run it in a browser or on a remote

machine somewhere. And that's fine.

I'm trying to give you enough flexibility so that you can

choose the tool, one of the three or four that I give you.

But, I also make sure that I test

all of our commands on those tools so that you have

a good experience while you're learning.

So, please pick the one through the next couple of

lectures, figure out which one you want to try, and you

don't necessarily have to watch them all now.

Skip past the ones that aren't your OS, so you're jumping

into the course faster.

I'm looking forward to getting you started in the command

line.
