I know that there's lots of Web-based Kubernetes and Docker

experiences out there, and there's Web-based coding things.

我知道有很多基于 Web 的 Kubernetes 和 Docker 体验，还有基于 Web 的编码。
* out there 到战场，在那里

But, I think that if you're seriously going to learn

Kubernetes, you need to know how to install it locally, and

you need to know how to install it on a server.

但是，我认为如果你想认真学习 Kubernetes，
你需要知道如何在本地安装它，
你需要知道如何在服务器上安装它。
* need to know 需了解；需知道
* seriously adv. 认真地；严重地，严肃地
* know how 懂得如何做; 能

I mean, a real server.

Part of the thing of this course is teaching you

the various ways to install Kubernetes.

本课程的部分内容是教你安装 Kubernetes 的各种方法。
* various adj. 各种各样的；多方面的

There's technically over 100 ways right now

to install Kubernetes, depending on your environment, and

your distribution, and your vendor and which cloud you're

in. There's just so many different ways to do it.

从技术上讲，现在有100多种安装 Kubernetes 的方法，
这取决于您的环境、您的发行版、您的供应商以及您所在的云。
有很多不同的方法。

I'm going to give you three, main ways for installing

whether you're on Windows, Mac, old Windows, or Linux,

or the Cloud. Then I'm going to give you a browser option

as a backup. So, these four, different ways have

their own pros and cons, and it's up to you

to make a decision. You don't have to watch all the videos.

我将提供三种主要的安装方法，
无论你是在Windows、Mac、旧Windows、Linux还是云上安装。
然后我会给你一个浏览器选项作为备份。
所以，这四种不同的方法各有利弊，
由你来决定。你不必看所有的视频。
* pros and cons利弊; 优缺点
* up to you一切由你; 你决定; 你说了算
* make a decision作出决定

You just have to decide which OS you're on and which one

you're going to try first.

你只需要决定你在哪个操作系统上，你要先尝试哪个操作系统。

If that one doesn't seem to work out for you, come back

here to these installation videos.

如果那一个似乎不适合你，回到这里到这些安装影片。
* seem to 似乎，好象；看起来
* work out 解决；算出；实现；制定出；消耗完；弄懂；锻炼
* come back 回来；记起；恢复原状，重新流行

You can look at the slides, you can click on the links

and try a different option if that fits you better.

Sometimes running locally can be easy,

but sometimes running locally can be hard if you don't have

enough resources.

Kubernetes is known for using a significant amount of CPU

and RAM even at idle.

There's a lot of things going on and it's not necessarily

as simple as running Docker locally.

So, you may not have all the memory, or the

battery power, to run Kubernetes on your own machine.

You may decide to run it in a browser or on a remote

machine somewhere. And that's fine.

I'm trying to give you enough flexibility so that you can

choose the tool, one of the three or four that I give you.

But, I also make sure that I test

all of our commands on those tools so that you have

a good experience while you're learning.

So, please pick the one through the next couple of

lectures, figure out which one you want to try, and you

don't necessarily have to watch them all now.

Skip past the ones that aren't your OS, so you're jumping

into the course faster.

I'm looking forward to getting you started in the command

line.
