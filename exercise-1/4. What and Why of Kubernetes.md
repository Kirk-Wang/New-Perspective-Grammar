It allowed us to package up our apps and distribute them

around different computers using common HTTP protocols.

That made it really easy to get apps to

different places when they're needed.

Then it had a common runtime that allowed us to run many

different copies of the same thing on a single OS, which

means we could now put more work on a machine than we

previously would have. We could replace those parts even

faster.

This comes to my easiest definition for what is

orchestration, at least when it comes to containers, and

that is making many servers act like one.

Allowing you to use one file

to describe your app or one command to deploy it to a

thousand computers.

All that stuff allows us to manage the same set

of machines, whether it's one machine or a thousand

machines, with the same level of effort.

That, my friends, is how the container orchestrator was

born. We've got actually a lot

more tools in the ecosystem than just Kubernetes.

Let's just take a moment to think about Kubernetes

and what's in common with all of these other tools.

Really, there's a few key attributes that

all of these things do

in common. The first is obviously they take images of apps

and code, and they run it across

many different computers. All of these generally do some

sort of basic monitoring, or awareness,

of whether that app is functioning correctly and needs

to be replaced. We commonly refer to that as healthchecks

now. Depending on which orchestrator you have, you

get various other features around networking, and

storage, and security, and inbound

proxies that we call Ingress in Kubernetes, logging and

just so much other stuff.

One key attribute of a lot of these, and especially of

the ones that are still successful, is that they come with

a way for us to be declarative rather than imperative.

We'll talk about the difference between those two and how

that affects containers later.

Just know that declarative tends to be the way we're all

going. They're all created with

this idea of an API that you can program against if you

don't like the tooling that comes with it. That's

definitely true of Kubernetes. It is all API driven, and

that's true of a lot of the other popular orchestrators as

well.

Here's just a short list. We're not going to go through the

list, but it's really an idea of that containers brought

forth the idea with various teams and software companies on

how we might bring a bunch of machines together to do a bunch of work.

That resulted in at least a half a

dozen projects. There's a lot that aren't on this list,

including one from Azure at Microsoft and

other teams. But the point is, we're talking about

Kubernetes, but it's not the only game in town, right.

It's definitely, right now, the one that everyone's

learning and talking about. It's popular.

But along the way, eventually, you

might want to learn another tool like my Swarm Mastery

Course, or maybe Amazon's ECS, which is

a common choice if you're on Amazon, etc.

One of the common tools here that

these are all relying on is Docker Engine.

We'll talk about what a container runtime, like Docker

Engine, is later.

We'll talk about different options for that. A vast

majority of these do rely on Docker as

the way to start the containers and manage them.

These are all providing just

an API layer on top of that to control it from a central point. Here's

one of the many things that allows Kubernetes to stand

above all these tools is that

it created an ecosystem of distributions.

So, much like Linux as distributions, now

Kubernetes has many.

Let's talk about that for a second.
