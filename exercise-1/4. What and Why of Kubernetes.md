That, my friends, is how the container orchestrator was

我的朋友们，容器编排就是这样诞生的。

born. We've got actually a lot

more tools in the ecosystem than just Kubernetes.

Let's just take a moment to think about Kubernetes

and what's in common with all of these other tools.

proxies that we call Ingress in Kubernetes, logging and

just so much other stuff.

* just so much 太多的

One key attribute of a lot of these, and especially of

其中一个关键的特点就是，

the ones that are still successful, is that they come with

a way for us to be declarative rather than imperative.

going. They're all created with

this idea of an API that you can program against if you

don't like the tooling that comes with it. That's

它们都是用这个API的思想创建的，如果您不喜欢它附带的工具，您可以针对它进行编程。
* against prep.反对;与…相反;逆;违反;对…不利;紧靠;倚;碰;撞

definitely true of Kubernetes. It is all API driven, and

that's true of a lot of the other popular orchestrators as

well.

Here's just a short list. We're not going to go through the

list, but it's really an idea of that containers brought

forth the idea with various teams and software companies on

how we might bring a bunch of machines together to do a bunch of work.

That resulted in at least a half a

dozen projects. There's a lot that aren't on this list,

including one from Azure at Microsoft and

other teams. But the point is, we're talking about

Kubernetes, but it's not the only game in town, right.

It's definitely, right now, the one that everyone's

learning and talking about. It's popular.

But along the way, eventually, you

might want to learn another tool like my Swarm Mastery

Course, or maybe Amazon's ECS, which is

a common choice if you're on Amazon, etc.

One of the common tools here that

these are all relying on is Docker Engine.

We'll talk about what a container runtime, like Docker

Engine, is later.

We'll talk about different options for that. A vast

majority of these do rely on Docker as

the way to start the containers and manage them.

These are all providing just

an API layer on top of that to control it from a central point. Here's

one of the many things that allows Kubernetes to stand

above all these tools is that

it created an ecosystem of distributions.

So, much like Linux as distributions, now

Kubernetes has many.

Let's talk about that for a second.
