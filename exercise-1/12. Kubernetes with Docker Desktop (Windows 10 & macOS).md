Docker Desktop is often the best and easiest way

to run Kubernetes locally on your machine.

Docker Desktop 通常是在您的机器上本地运行Kubernetes的最佳和最简单的方法。

If you have a modern Windows or Mac machine, chances

are you can use this option, and you may already be running

Docker Desktop now. But if you're on Windows, there

are a few requirements to get Docker Desktop running

that includes it having Hyper-V, which means it has

to be a Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise

or Education edition.

如果你有一台现代的 Windows 或 Mac 电脑，
你可以使用这个选项，你现在可能已经在运行 Docker 桌面了。
但如果你使用的是 Windows 操作系统，运行 Docker 桌面有一些要求，
其中包括拥有 Hyper-V，
这意味着它必须是 Windows 10 专业版、企业版或教育版。
* chances are that ...是可能的

It can't be Windows 10 Home.

不可能是 Windows 10 家庭版。

That doesn't include Hyper-V at the moment.

目前还不包括 Hyper-V。
* at the moment 此刻;目前;眼下

So, you're not going to be able to use Docker Desktop.

所以，你不能使用 Docker 桌面。

You'll want to go to the next video where you can use

minikube as a backup option.

您需要转到下一个视频，在那里您可以使用 minikube 作为备份选项。

If you're on Mac, it tends to just work.

如果你用的是 Mac，它就会正常工作。
* tend to 趋向；注意；易于；有…的倾向

Windows, you need a little bit more memory.

Windows，你需要更多的内存。

I would say on the Mac side you need at least 4GB of

RAM. On the Windows, side you might need 6 to

make everything work well.

我想说在 Mac 端你至少需要 4GB 的内存。
在 Windows 上，你可能需要 6 个才能使一切正常工作。

So, if you don't have them, go hit these links in the

slides, or in the references, to directly download

the exe or the dmg for

your respective operating system.

因此，如果您没有它们，
请点击幻灯片或参考资料中的这些链接，
直接下载各自操作系统的 exe 或 dmg 。
* slides 幻灯片
* respective adj.分别的;各自的

Install them like you normally would.

Then, once they're running, you're going to go into

settings. On the Windows side, the settings are

in the bottom right menu under the Docker

icon. You'll go in there, and you'll see an option

to enable Kubernetes.

像平常一样安装它们。
然后，一旦它们运行，您将进入设置。
在 Windows 侧，设置位于 Docker 图标下的右下角菜单中。
你将进入那里，你将看到一个启用 Kubernetes 的选项。

It's not turned on, by default, because it does use more

resources than Docker does, by default.

In fact, if you're paying attention, Kubernetes tends to

use 5 to 10 percent of your CPU and

a good little chunk of RAM on a local machine.

So, you may not want to have this enabled always.

The good news here is you can enable and disable that

checkbox at your leisure and it'll just

turn off and turn on.

Now, if you don't see that Kubernetes option in

your settings, then go back to the menu and

you'll want to switch to Linux containers. So, if you see

this option, that means you're currently running in Windows

containers options, and Kubernetes locally

doesn't work with Windows containers yet.

It will only run on Windows 10 with

Linux container mode. So, you want to go hit that.

It'll take a few minutes. You'll be able to open up

powershell and type to kubectl get all,

and then you should see back your one

line of your server that's locally installed.

That's K U B E C T L get

all. If you're on Mac, then your little

Docker icon, called Moby, will

be in the top right. You just click on that Moby icon and

then you'll get this menu. You go to preferences and

then you'll see a similar option to enable Kubernetes.

You should just check that top box there.

The same with Windows. If you want to disable it later,

just come back in here. Check the box.

It won't remove your containers or

remove Kubernetes at all. It simply turns it off.

It basically stops all of the containers to save

resources when you're not using Kubernetes.

This allows you to run Docker. If you just want to use

Docker or Docker Compose without also having Kubernetes

running at the same time. Then of course on Mac, go

and do the same thing. Use the command kubectl get nodes.

That should return one line that lets you know that

Docker Desktop is working and you're ready to go.
