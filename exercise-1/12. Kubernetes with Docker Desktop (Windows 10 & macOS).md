Docker Desktop is often the best and easiest way

to run Kubernetes locally on your machine.

If you have a modern Windows or Mac machine, chances

are you can use this option, and you may already be running

Docker Desktop now. But if you're on Windows, there

are a few requirements to get Docker Desktop running

that includes it having Hyper-V, which means it has

to be a Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise

or Education edition.

It can't be Windows 10 Home.

That doesn't include Hyper-V at the moment.

So, you're not going to be able to use Docker Desktop.

You'll want to go to the next video where you can use

minikube as a backup option.

If you're on Mac, it tends to just work.

Windows, you need a little bit more memory.

I would say on the Mac side you need at least 4GB of

RAM. On the Windows, side you might need 6 to

make everything work well.

So, if you don't have them, go hit these links in the

slides, or in the references, to directly download

the exe or the dmg for

your respective operating system.

Install them like you normally would.

Then, once they're running, you're going to go into

settings. On the Windows side, the settings are

in the bottom right menu under the Docker

icon. You'll go in there, and you'll see an option

to enable Kubernetes.

It's not turned on, by default, because it does use more

resources than Docker does, by default.

In fact, if you're paying attention, Kubernetes tends to

use 5 to 10 percent of your CPU and

a good little chunk of RAM on a local machine.

So, you may not want to have this enabled always.

The good news here is you can enable and disable that

checkbox at your leisure and it'll just

turn off and turn on.

Now, if you don't see that Kubernetes option in

your settings, then go back to the menu and

you'll want to switch to Linux containers. So, if you see

this option, that means you're currently running in Windows

containers options, and Kubernetes locally

doesn't work with Windows containers yet.

It will only run on Windows 10 with

Linux container mode. So, you want to go hit that.

It'll take a few minutes. You'll be able to open up

powershell and type to kubectl get all,

and then you should see back your one

line of your server that's locally installed.

That's K U B E C T L get

all. If you're on Mac, then your little

Docker icon, called Moby, will

be in the top right. You just click on that Moby icon and

then you'll get this menu. You go to preferences and

then you'll see a similar option to enable Kubernetes.

You should just check that top box there.

The same with Windows. If you want to disable it later,

just come back in here. Check the box.

It won't remove your containers or

remove Kubernetes at all. It simply turns it off.

It basically stops all of the containers to save

resources when you're not using Kubernetes.

This allows you to run Docker. If you just want to use

Docker or Docker Compose without also having Kubernetes

running at the same time. Then of course on Mac, go

and do the same thing. Use the command kubectl get nodes.

That should return one line that lets you know that

Docker Desktop is working and you're ready to go.
