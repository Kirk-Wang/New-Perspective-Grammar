Over the last several lectures, we have learned a lot about

the built in logs command.

在过去的几堂课中，我们学到了很多关于内置日志命令的知识。

Then, we sort of ran into a brick wall a little bit.

然后，我们遇到了一些困难。
* sort of 有几分;近似;有那么点儿
* brick wall砖墙
* a little bit一点

We figured out that there are some serious limits around

that log command, especially if you're going to use it in a

production-like setup where you're going to need to manage

multiple pods and see those things all at once.

我们发现这个日志命令有一些严重的限制，
特别是如果您要在类似于生产的设置中使用它，
您需要管理多个 pod 并同时查看这些内容。
* all at once 同时; 一起; 突然; 忽然

Maybe it's 10 pods or 20 pods.

可能是10个或20个。

How do you deal with all that when you don't have a solid,

easy log command to use? If you're a shell

or programming guru, you could just write your own little

automation that uses the logs command and

gets around some of these shortcomings.

当您没有一个可靠的、容易使用的日志命令时，
如何处理所有这些问题呢?
如果您是 shell 或编程专家，
那么您可以编写自己的小自动化程序，
使用 logs 命令并避开其中的一些缺点。
* deal with处理; 应付; 与…打交道; 克制; 冷静面对; 论述; 讨论; 涉及; 与…做买卖; 和…有生意往来
* guru n.古鲁(印度教或锡克教的宗教导师或领袖);专家;权威;大师

I kind of imagined here what that might look like, but

we don't need to do that.

我在这里想象了它的样子，但是我们不需要这样做。
* kind of 稍微; 有几分; 有点儿
* imagined v.想象;设想;误以为;胡乱猜想;猜测;料想;认为
imagine的过去分词和过去式

The project already exists.

这个项目已经存在了。

So, let's use the power of free open source and

use Stern, which is a great way and adds tons

of benefits. It's from a company known as Wercker.

所以，让我们利用免费开源的力量，使用 Stern，
这是一个伟大的方式，
并增加了大量的好处。
来自一家叫 Wercker 的公司。
* tons of 大量; 一大堆; 许多，无数的
* benefits n. 利益，好处；救济金
* known as 被称为; 被认为是; 以…而闻名

It's on GitHub. So, you have installation options

for how to get it.

在 GitHub。所以，你有安装选项来获得它。

You can get it with Brew for Mac.

你可以通过Brew for Mac获得它。

You can download and build it manually for different

operating systems.

您可以下载并为不同的操作系统手动构建它。

There's details here on that.

这里有详细信息。

The point of this is that

I think that you're going to try it and like it.

关键是我认为你会尝试并喜欢它。

It's something that will basically replace your

logs command for anything other than the simplest commands

on local machines for maybe just looking at one pod real

它基本上可以替代您的日志命令，
除了本地机器上最简单的命令之外，
可以快速查看一个 pod。
* for anything 无论如何
* other than 除了…以外
* basically adv.大体上;基本上;总的说来;从根本上说
* simplest adj.易于理解的;易做的;简单的;朴素的;简朴的;不加装饰的;(用在名词前表示强调)纯粹的，完全的，不折不扣的

quick. If you don't have it installed, here is some

quick little information on different ways you can install

如果你还没有安装它，这里有一些关于不同安装方法的简短信息。

it. If you're not using Mac OS with Brew,

or if you are not planning on using the

sh pod utility container, again that

I talked about at the beginning of this course, you can

install it various ways here.

如果你不使用 Mac OS 带的 Brew，
或者你不打算使用 sh pod 实用工具容器，
我在这门课开始时提到过，
你可以通过各种方式安装它。
* at the beginning of 在…初

Let me just get myself out of the way so you can see that

command. Again, you can go to these slides.

让我把自己挪开，这样你们就能看到命令了。你们可以去看这些幻灯片。
* out of the way 偏僻的；不同寻常的；不挡道；把…移开

It's slides.kubernetesmastery.com, and

copy these commands for downloading it onto a Linux

machine. Once you have it, it's a single binary,

and it's pretty cut and dry.

它是 slides.kubernetesmastery.com，
复制这些命令以便下载到 Linux 机器上。
一旦你有了它，
它是一个单一的二进制，它很简单。
* onto prep. 向，朝，在……之上； 
* cut-and-dry 早准备好的 ; 呆板的

Let's use a simple Stern command here and just type

in the name of something and see if the

regex type queries work.

让我们在这里使用一个简单的 Stern 命令，
然后输入一些东西的名称，
看看 regex 类型查询是否有效。
* type in 打入，输入

S T E R N pingpong.

Then, I get back all the logs since pingpong

started, in color coded format, per pod

name.

然后，我得到所有的日志，从 pingpong 开始，
在彩色编码格式，每个 pod 的名称。

It's a lot of stuff. You can see it's going to go pretty

fast along the screen. I'm going to control c out of that.

很多东西。你可以看到它在屏幕上走得很快。我将 control c 退出它。
* along prep.沿着;顺着;靠着…边;沿着…的某处(或旁边)

There are lots of options with Stern.

Stern 有很多选项。

I encourage you to play around with it.

我鼓励你玩它。
* encourage v.支持;鼓励;激励;鼓动;劝告;怂恿;促进;助长;刺激

One more cool way.

还有一个很酷的方法。

Course it does other things as well, like tail,

where you can make sure it only starts with the last line

so that you don't get a flood, like I just got.

In this case, we can add timestamps so we can see the

timestamps of the logs.

We can go ahead and try that again with the pingpong.

stern tail 1 timestamps pingpong.

You can see there are timestamps added before

the actual log output.

Neat. There are other options here, including the

ability to go across namespaces to use selectors

like we had with the original logs command.

I encourage you to explore more of that because we'll be

using it later, and I'm sure that you'll be using it in

your daily life.
