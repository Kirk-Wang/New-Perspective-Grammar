Over the last several lectures, we have learned a lot about

the built in logs command.

Then, we sort of ran into a brick wall a little bit.

We figured out that there are some serious limits around

that log command, especially if you're going to use it in a

production-like setup where you're going to need to manage

multiple pods and see those things all at once.

Maybe it's 10 pods or 20 pods.

How do you deal with all that when you don't have a solid,

easy log command to use? If you're a shell

or programming guru, you could just write your own little

automation that uses the logs command and

gets around some of these shortcomings.

I kind of imagined here what that might look like, but

we don't need to do that.

The project already exists.

So, let's use the power of free open source and

use Stern, which is a great way and adds tons

of benefits. It's from a company known as Wercker.

It's on GitHub. So, you have installation options

for how to get it.

You can get it with Brew for Mac.

You can download and build it manually for different

operating systems.

There's details here on that.

The point of this is that

I think that you're going to try it and like it.

It's something that will basically replace your

logs command for anything other than the simplest commands

on local machines for maybe just looking at one pod real

quick. If you don't have it installed, here is some

quick little information on different ways you can install

it. If you're not using Mac OS with Brew,

or if you are not planning on using the

sh pod utility container, again that

I talked about at the beginning of this course, you can

install it various ways here.

Let me just get myself out of the way so you can see that

command. Again, you can go to these slides.

It's slides.kubernetesmastery.com, and

copy these commands for downloading it onto a Linux

machine. Once you have it, it's a single binary,

and it's pretty cut and dry.

Let's use a simple Stern command here and just type

in the name of something and see if the

regex type queries work.

S T E R N pingpong.

Then, I get back all the logs since pingpong

started, in color coded format, per pod

name.

It's a lot of stuff. You can see it's going to go pretty

fast along the screen. I'm going to control c out of that.

There are lots of options with Stern.

I encourage you to play around with it.

One more cool way.

Course it does other things as well, like tail,

where you can make sure it only starts with the last line

so that you don't get a flood, like I just got.

In this case, we can add timestamps so we can see the

timestamps of the logs.

We can go ahead and try that again with the pingpong.

stern tail 1 timestamps pingpong.

You can see there are timestamps added before

the actual log output.

Neat. There are other options here, including the

ability to go across namespaces to use selectors

like we had with the original logs command.

I encourage you to explore more of that because we'll be

using it later, and I'm sure that you'll be using it in

your daily life.
