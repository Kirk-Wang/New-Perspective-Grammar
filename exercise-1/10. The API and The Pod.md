Now, everything we're doing will really be interacting

with the Kubernetes API.

现在，我们所做的一切都将真正与 Kubernetes API 交互。

That is one of the single binaries that needs

to be running on your master node or nodes.

这是需要在主节点或多个节点上运行的单个二进制文件之一。

That is going to provide access to

a huge amount of resources.

这将提供对大量资源的访问。
* a huge amount of 大量的

The resources are the objects in Kubernetes that we

get to mess with. Most of the things we'll be doing in this

course are all about learning the different types

of resources and then how to manage those.

资源是Kubernetes中的对象，
我们可以对其进行处理。
我们这门课的大部分内容都是
关于学习不同类型的资源
以及如何管理这些资源。
* get to 开始; 到达，抵达; 抓住；接触，和…取得联系
* mess with 干涉; 卷入; 与…有牵连

Whether it's through a command line or something else.

不管是通过命令行还是别的什么。

Some common examples that you're probably already aware of,

or you've heard of, include something like a pod, which

we'll get to talk about in a minute.

一些常见的例子，你可能已经知道，
或者你已经听说过，
包括像 pod 这样的东西，
我们马上会讲到。
* aware of 明白，了解，知道；意识到
* in a minute马上，立刻

A node which is like you think, a physical

machine, a VM or a physical server.

一个节点，就像你想的那样，
一个物理机器，
一个虚拟机或一个物理服务器。

That's a node and it is its own type of resource.

这是一个节点，它是自己的资源类型。

Then we have other things like services, deployments,

replicasets, stateful sets, daemon sets.

还有其他的，比如服务，部署，复制集，有状态集，守护进程集。

There's a whole bunch. We'll learn the important ones

throughout this course. There's honestly a lot of these

resources that you will probably never use.

有一大堆。
我们将在整个课程中学习重要的内容。
老实说，
这些资源中有很多你可能永远不会用到。

There's dozens of them.

有几十个。
* dozens of 几十；很多

It honestly isn't something that the average

person would need to know and memorize all of them.

老实说，这不是一般人需要知道和记住的。
* average person 正常人，普通人
* need to know 需了解；需知道
* memorize v.记忆;记住

It's really just about the ones you need to get your job

done and then you can ignore the rest.

它只是关于你完成工作所需要的，然后你可以忽略其他的。
* just about 勉强; 差一点就不; 差不多; 几乎; 近乎
* rest n.剩余部分;残留;其余;其余的人;其他事物;其他;休息时间;睡眠时间

Let's talk about the one that we all

need to know, and that's pods.

我们来讨论一个我们都需要知道的，那就是 pod。

Pod is a new concept that you didn't have in Docker,

you didn't have in Docker Compose.

Pod 是一个你在 Docker 中没有的新概念，你在Docker作曲中也没有。

It was created with Kubernetes as

an abstraction. So, it's really an idea.

它是用Kubernetes作为抽象概念创建的。
所以，这真的是一个想法。
* abstraction n.抽象概念;抽象;出神;心神专注;提取;抽取;分离

It's not a physical thing.

它不是一个物理的东西。
* physical adj. 物理的；身体的；物质的；根据自然规律的，符合自然法则的

You're not deploying a physical

binary that's called a pod.

你不是在部署一个叫做 pod 的物理二进制。

What a pod is, is it's an abstract

around multiple containers, or really

more accurately, one or more containers.

pod 是围绕多个容器的抽象概念，更准确地说，是一个或多个容器。
* accurately adv.准确地，精确；正确，正确地

In this drawing, you can see in the middle, we've got an

Nginx container in the box, in the middle with the

blue, and then around that is a larger

box that is the pod.

在这张图中，你可以看到在中间，
我们有一个 Nginx 容器在盒子里，
在中间是蓝色的，
在它周围是一个更大的盒子，那就是 pod。

The idea of a pod is it's the lowest deployable

unit in Kubernetes.

We can never actually touch containers directly.

We can only deploy, update and delete

pods. Most of the time, your pods will only have one

container in them. But sometimes, they can have more than

one, depending on your needs. In this case, an example is

Nginx with a logging container that's doing something

with logs right next to it.

A real world example might be a PHP container with

Nginx as the Web App in front.

One of the things about these pods is they

all get an IP address, and they get more

than that. They will always share the

IP address.

That means that these multiple containers in a pod

are always deployed together onto the same machine

together, and they're going to share localhost.

Which means that if you had two containers in there

and they needed to talk to each other, they could

technically use localhost because that networking

namespace, as we say, is shared

amongst those different containers.

There's other things, as well, where you can share volumes

between these containers, but the idea is that they're all

deployed into the same pod.

So, we'll use pods and be typing

pod commands throughout the rest of this course.

But, it is important that you understand this concept well

now because almost all the other things that deal

directly with containers are built upon this pod.

Again, we can't touch containers.

We can only deploy pods.

In reality, most of your pods,

they're not going to be multiple container.

The last thing to note here is that Docker doesn't know

about pods. The container engine doesn't understand

the concept of a pod.

So, what Kubernetes is doing in the background is

it's managing that pod to container relationship.

Then it's telling the engine, in this case the Docker

Engine, that container runtime, to start the containers

that it needs to start on a single machine.

We'll see a lot of that in action as we dive into the

tools.
