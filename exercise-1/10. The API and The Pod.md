Now, everything we're doing will really be interacting

with the Kubernetes API.

That is one of the single binaries that needs

to be running on your master node or nodes.

That is going to provide access to

a huge amount of resources.

The resources are the objects in Kubernetes that we

get to mess with. Most of the things we'll be doing in this

course are all about learning the different types

of resources and then how to manage those.

Whether it's through a command line or something else.

Some common examples that you're probably already aware of,

or you've heard of, include something like a pod, which

we'll get to talk about in a minute.

A node which is like you think, a physical

machine, a VM or a physical server.

That's a node and it is its own type of resource.

Then we have other things like services, deployments,

replicasets, stateful sets, daemon sets.

There's a whole bunch. We'll learn the important ones

throughout this course. There's honestly a lot of these

resources that you will probably never use.

There's dozens of them.

It honestly isn't something that the average

person would need to know and memorize all of them.

It's really just about the ones you need to get your job

done and then you can ignore the rest.

Let's talk about the one that we all

need to know, and that's pods.

Pod is a new concept that you didn't have in Docker,

you didn't have in Docker Compose.

It was created with Kubernetes as

an abstraction. So, it's really an idea.

It's not a physical thing.

You're not deploying a physical

binary that's called a pod.

What a pod is, is it's an abstract

around multiple containers, or really

more accurately, one or more containers.

In this drawing, you can see in the middle, we've got an

Nginx container in the box, in the middle with the

blue, and then around that is a larger

box that is the pod.

The idea of a pod is it's the lowest deployable

unit in Kubernetes.

We can never actually touch containers directly.

We can only deploy, update and delete

pods. Most of the time, your pods will only have one

container in them. But sometimes, they can have more than

one, depending on your needs. In this case, an example is

Nginx with a logging container that's doing something

with logs right next to it.

A real world example might be a PHP container with

Nginx as the Web App in front.

One of the things about these pods is they

all get an IP address, and they get more

than that. They will always share the

IP address.

That means that these multiple containers in a pod

are always deployed together onto the same machine

together, and they're going to share localhost.

Which means that if you had two containers in there

and they needed to talk to each other, they could

technically use localhost because that networking

namespace, as we say, is shared

amongst those different containers.

There's other things, as well, where you can share volumes

between these containers, but the idea is that they're all

deployed into the same pod.

So, we'll use pods and be typing

pod commands throughout the rest of this course.

But, it is important that you understand this concept well

now because almost all the other things that deal

directly with containers are built upon this pod.

Again, we can't touch containers.

We can only deploy pods.

In reality, most of your pods,

they're not going to be multiple container.

The last thing to note here is that Docker doesn't know

about pods. The container engine doesn't understand

the concept of a pod.

So, what Kubernetes is doing in the background is

it's managing that pod to container relationship.

Then it's telling the engine, in this case the Docker

Engine, that container runtime, to start the containers

that it needs to start on a single machine.

We'll see a lot of that in action as we dive into the

tools.
