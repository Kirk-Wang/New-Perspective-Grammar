Before we get to changing the rng to a DaemonSet,

we need to talk about YAML.

在将 rng 更改为 DaemonSet 之前，我们需要讨论 YAML。

What we're going to do now is we're going to essentially

apply a YAML of all of our services,

and all of our deployments, into one, big file.

现在，我们要做的是基本上将应用一个我们所有 services 和
所有 deployments 的 YAML, 合二为一, 大文件。

We're going to overwrite what we're already running on

the cluster. So, let's just talk about YAML real quick.

我们将覆盖已经在集群上运行的内容。让我们快速讨论一下 YAML。

We're going to go more in-depth into authoring YAML and

all the details about it in a few lectures down the road.

在接下来的几节课中，我们将更深入地介绍 YAML 的创作以及有关它的所有细节。
* in-depth 彻底的; 深入详尽的
* down the road 在将来，今后

For now, let's just get the basics out of the way

so that we can deploy this thing.

现在，让我们先把基础知识讲清楚，这样我们就可以部署这个东西了。

So far, you've been creating stuff on this cluster

with the run command, the create command, the expose

command. These are all generator commands.

到目前为止，您已经使用 run 命令、create 命令和 expose 命令
在这个集群中创建了一些东西。这些都是生成器命令。

They generate YAML for us and turn it into

JSON technically.

他们为我们生成了 YAML，并在技术上将其转换为JSON。

Then, they send it to the server.

然后，他们将其发送到服务器。

So, that makes it really easy for us to use the

command line. We don't have to know all the details of the

YAML before we can even get started.

这让我们很容易使用命令行。
在开始之前，我们不必了解 YAML 的所有详细信息。

In case you're curious, there's a couple of commands that

you've probably noticed have a -f on them, the create and

the apply. They can both take a YAML file

and do stuff with it.

如果你好奇的话，你可能会注意到有两个命令上面有 -f，分别是 create 和 apply。
它们都可以使用 YAML 文件进行操作。

The large difference between them is that create only

creates. There are other commands, like delete

and edit and stuff like that, that will be more literal

in what they're doing with the YAML.

他们之间最大的区别是，create 只是 creates。
还有其他一些命令，比如 delete 和 edit 之类的，
它们在使用 YAML 时会更加直白。

The apply is a universal command.

apply 是一个通用命令。

It can create, it can update and edit.

它可以创建、更新和编辑。

It can do all these things.

它可以做所有这些事情。

It can even delete if you give it an extra option to do

that. It doesn't do it by default for safety.

如果你给它一个额外的选项，它甚至可以删除。出于安全考虑，它不会默认这样做。

But, it can be the one shot to do

everything regardless of the state.

但是，这可能是一个机会做一切，无论状态如何。

We'll talk more about imperative versus declarative later.

稍后我们将更多地讨论命令式和声明式。

If you look at these two, you can think of the create

command as more imperative because we know exactly what

it's doing. We use apply as a more

declarative state that you might use in your automation.

如果您看看这两个命令，您可以认为 create 命令更为重要，
因为我们确切地知道它在做什么。
我们使用 apply 作为更具声明性的状态，您可以在自动化中使用它。

When you look in these YAML files, the resource

definition is known as a manifest.

查看这些 YAML 文件时，资源定义被称为清单。

The word manifest isn't used in there anywhere.

manifest 这个词在任何地方都没用。

But, that's what we call it.

但是，这就是我们所说的。

It has four, key parts that we'll expand on later.

它有四个关键部分，我们稍后会详细介绍。

You can see here the kind, the API version, the metadata,

and the spec. Every one of these resources has to have

those four filled out.

Then you can include multiple resources

in the same YAML file with these three dashes here that

you see in the middle. Those three dashes separate one

resource from another.

This would be a YAML file with multiple manifests

in it.

There's a different way to format it.

You can technically use this YAML way to do it.

I don't see this a lot in the real world, but it

can be used where you can create a list

of items here that would each one be its own

manifest. But, I don't see that much.

So, we're going to stick with the way I just showed you

before.

Now what we're going to do is we're going to run an apply

command using a YAML I'm providing you in the course

that has all of the resources that we've taken

so far in this DockerCoins miner business

that we've got going. So, imagine if you didn't have

anything on your cluster, you could run this single

command, and it would deploy all the things, expose

all the ports.

But, we've already got stuff running here.

So, this is going to be a little tricky when we run it.

It's going to give us some warnings because we're

technically overwriting things that we created

with run commands or create commands, and we're

now using the apply YAML against those

same objects. So technically, that's a no no.

When you go into production, or anywhere on a cluster

server, you want to stick with the same process.

If you're using apply, you should start with apply and

stick with the YAML that you're using.

If you're using create commands, then later on you're going

to use edit commands to change things, stuff like that.

At the command line, let's just type kubectl apply

-f https

k8smastery.com/dockercoins.yaml with

Y A M L. It doesn't really matter if it's...when

you make your files, just so you know, you don't have to

have four characters or three characters.

It doesn't really matter.

Some of the files in this course will have the full

Y A M L, some other ones might have Y M L.

It doesn't really matter. But in this case, it's a

four-letter extension.

You'll see these warnings that I was talking about.

It's just saying, hey, it's best that you stick with one

pattern or another.

We'll talk about the three patterns we're using

Kubernetes. But for now, basically this brought

us all up to speed with each other.

We're all using the same config regardless of what we

played with in the past.

We're now at a consistent state with each other, and we can

move forward with DockerCoins rng

DaemonSets.
