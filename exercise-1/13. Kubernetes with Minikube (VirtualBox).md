If you're on Windows 10 Home or possibly an

older version of Windows like 8.1 or 8,

or maybe Windows 7, you can use

Minikube. Minikube is a lot like Docker Toolbox

used to be. And that was using Docker Machine, if you

remember that it was a nice little utility that would

help you create a VM with VirtualBox that would

automatically install Docker and then connect the tool.

Well, Minikube is a lot like that.

It's using VirtualBox by default, although it can use

other virtualization engines.

But in this case I'm for this course I'm only

testing Minikube with Windows

10 and only the

Minikube with VirtualBox, which is the typical setup for

someone on Windows 10 Home.

Because if you're using Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise, you

should be using Docker Desktop.

That's a lot better, a lot more features and

just generally works nicer.

So let's check this out.

We've got to get a couple of things here.

This is kind of the tricky part of it is it's not just one

install for Minikube. We've got to get VirtualBox and then

we've got to get the Kubernetes command line called kubectl

and we've got install Minikube.

The first thing up, we're going to download the three

things and then we're going to install

them and then kubectl is a manual install.

And then we can do a start on Minikube and we'll

walk through it together.

I've got the three different applications I'm gonna have to

download. These are all in the resources for this video and

we can start with just downloading Minikube.

If you go to get started and you choose Windows and

you can download the installer here, you can also use

Chocolatey if you're a fancy administrator on Windows

and you know what Chocolatey is, but you can download the

installer.

Same goes for VirtualBox.

You can go to downloads than under Windows.

You can choose download that file.

And then under Kubernetes' website

where you would get kubectl because it's just a single

small little binary.

You can see here install kubectl on Windows.

The trick with this one is it's going to let you download

it, but it's not always up-to-date.

So here's what we have to do.

We want to get the most current version of kubectl because

that's the command line tool you're gonna be using

throughout this course to talk to your cluster.

So it doesn't necessarily require that we have

the latest version, but I want you to know how to get the

latest version on Windows.

Here, they're saying that you need to know what the latest

version is so you can open up that text file in a new tab,

and we can see here that the version

1.16.3 is the latest release when I recorded this video.

We are going to download

the file and we can click here, but the problem

is these links aren't updated. They're sending us to the

1.16.0 release.

So what I want to do is I'm going to copy the link,

I'm going to open up a new tab, paste it in my browser

and then back up and change the version number

to the latest version in that text file.

Hopefully that makes sense. Then it's gonna download the

file and I'll have it locally on my machine.

Now that I've got these three things in my downloads

folder, the one thing you definitely want to do with

kubectl is right click on it, go down

to properties, and click unblock.

This is common of any zip file or any executable

you download. And this will prevent us from having

additional warnings in the future when we're trying to run

it.

All right. Now you can install VirtualBox like you normally

would.

And that'll give you several prompts for installing drivers

and ask you for administrative permissions, and if you've

already got a VirtualBox installed in your machine for

Docker Machine, you know, for Docker Toolbox, those tools,

you don't need to reinstall it.

You might just want to make sure it's up to date, but you

don't have to have a different version.

There's nothing special about it.

And then we're going to also run the Minikube installer.

Now, the Minikube installer simply puts the

Minikube utility inside your program

files and it doesn't connect

all the pieces together yet.

So the last piece of this puzzle is once that's installed,

we're going to open up PowerShell, just regular old

PowerShell.

Not the ISC.

You tend to not want to use the ISC or the x86

versions, you just want the Windows PowerShell.

And now that the Minikube setup is finished,

you can do the last piece of the puzzle, which is to get

kubectl installed, because once we try to run

Minikube, Minikube is going to create a VM,

install communities in it, and then it's going to setup the

kubectl command line to talk to it.

For me, I'm going to put it in a new tools

folder that I tend to have on all my Windows systems

anyway, and then I need to add that folder to my path.

This is what most installation programs do for you when

they put stuff in program files.

Since we don't have an installer for kubectl,

we've got to do this manually ourselves.

Makedir.

I'm going to put it in the root of C under tools.

Then I'm going to copy the

download file.

kubectl.

I'm going to copy that into the tools directory.

Then I should be able to a dir on tools

and see that kubectl.

Now, since you've manually downloaded that, you're probably

going to want to check a couple of times a year to make

sure that you have the kubectl version.

We'll talk later about compatibility, but generally,

kubectl can talk to clusters, either the same

minor version or one minor version out of date.

So a 1.16 can talk to a 1.14 or

a 1.17.

Now, the other thing we need to do is we need to change our

path. If you just search for a path

inside of your Start menu, you should

be able to see this option that says Edit the system

environment variables. That's what we want to do.

We want to click under environment variables

and then find the path for the whole system.

Click, edit there and then we're going to add a new

location to the paths, and we're going to

add tools.

You can do this once. This can be a place you can put

whatever you want there.

You can also do stuff through Chocolatey.

You might even be able to install this through Chocolatey,

which is a package manager for Windows.

I'm not going to go through all of that because there's a

process to set up Chocolatey and a whole command line for

that. But, if you check that out, you might build the find

Minikube and kubectl on there.

In order to get our path, we need to close

our shell and reopen it so that our path will be updated.

I should be able to type kubectl and

it works.

I just typed the word kubectl and it returned stuff without

an error. That means that it can find the kubectl

in my tools folder.

The next step is for us to run the

Minikube setup.

That's minikube start.

This will take a few minutes. It'll need to download an ISO

file. It'll need to set up Kubernetes and all the different

containers. It's got some work to do.

It might take up to five minutes or more, maybe, depending

on the speed of your system.

I think on mine, it takes somewhere between three and five

minutes. You might even get some prompts

to set up drivers or ask for permissions.

A lot of this is Minikube talking to VirtualBox and

getting that connection set up properly.

Once you have this VM set up, you can

go in and change the CPUs and memory resources

inside of VirtualBox. This is just the default setup for

two CPUs and 2GBs of RAM.

So, Kubernetes, if it needs more than 2GBs of RAM, you'll

need to go into VirtualBox and give it.

The other thing is you'll need to learn some of the other

Minikube command lines.

There's other things in there like Minikube stop, which

will stop your Kubernetes server.

You can delete it. You can, you know, you can

create other ones. There's lots of options there.

Just type minikube and hit enter, and you'll see

different options at the command line.

You don't normally need to keep VirtualBox running, but you

can see here that I've got this Minikube and it's running

and installing the VirtualBox.

Now, this is the view of a successful

setup of Minikube.

If you've done the start command and you've gone eventually

through all these different steps, and you get to the

bottom and it says done, then it's

done its job. And it's technically added a config file in

your profile. So, if I type kubectl version, I

get back both the client and the server version, and it's

OK if they're a little bit different.

Then kubectl get nodes.

I could use kubectl get nodes. Then you see the Minikube

server that you're talking to.

This means it's running and you're good to go.

If you want to stop it for the day, make sure you remember

to do a minikube stop

and it won't delete the machine. It'll just stop it.

Or, you can go into VirtualBox and manually shut it down.

The last little thing here is if you happen to be on a

system where you get an error that says

this computer doesn't have VT-X or AMD-v enabled,

you need to enable virtualization in your computer bios.

That is because this is creating a virtual machine on top

of your windows OS.

If you have never use virtualization

before, you may need to go in your bios and turn it on.

It also might mean you're using a virtual Windows machine.

And that that virtual Windows machine cannot

use virtualization.

That's known as nested virtualization.

It's a little fancy, but not every virtualization

technology supports it.

So, if you're still trying to figure that one out, just

search nested virtualization for whatever

platform you're using your VM on.
