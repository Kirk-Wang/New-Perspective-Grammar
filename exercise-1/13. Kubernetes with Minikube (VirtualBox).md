If you're on Windows 10 Home or possibly an

older version of Windows like 8.1 or 8,

or maybe Windows 7, you can use

Minikube. Minikube is a lot like Docker Toolbox

used to be. And that was using Docker Machine, if you

remember that it was a nice little utility that would

help you create a VM with VirtualBox that would

automatically install Docker and then connect the tool.

如果您使用的是 Windows 10 Home，
或者可能是 8.1 或 8 等较旧版本的 Windows，
或者是 Windows 7，则可以使用 Minikube。
Minikube 很像 Docker 工具箱。
那是使用 Docker Machine，
如果你记得它是一个很好的小实用程序，
可以帮助你用 VirtualBox 创建一个虚拟机，
自动安装 Docker，然后连接工具。
* used to be 过去是

Well, Minikube is a lot like that.

Minikube 和这个很像

It's using VirtualBox by default, although it can use

other virtualization engines.

它默认使用的是 VirtualBox ，尽管它可以使用其他的虚拟化引擎。

But in this case I'm for this course I'm only

testing Minikube with Windows

10 and only the

Minikube with VirtualBox, which is the typical setup for

someone on Windows 10 Home.

但在本例中，我只在 Windows 10 上测试 Minikube，
只在 VirtualBox 上测试 Minikube，这是 windows10 家庭版的典型设置。

Because if you're using Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise, you

should be using Docker Desktop.

因为如果你用的是 Windows10Pro 或者企业版，你应该用的是 Docker 桌面。

That's a lot better, a lot more features and

just generally works nicer.

这样好多了，功能也多了，而且总体上工作得更好。

So let's check this out.

所以让我们来看看这个。

We've got to get a couple of things here.

我们这里有一些东西。

This is kind of the tricky part of it is it's not just one

install for Minikube. We've got to get VirtualBox and then

we've got to get the Kubernetes command line called kubectl

and we've got install Minikube.

这是一个棘手的部分，
因为它不只是安装一个 Minikube。
我们需要 VirtualBox，然后我们需要 Kubernetes 命令行，
叫做 kubectl，然后我们需要安装 Minikube。

The first thing up, we're going to download the three

things and then we're going to install

them and then kubectl is a manual install.

首先，我们要下载这三样东西，然后安装它们，
然后 kubectl 是手动安装的。

And then we can do a start on Minikube and we'll

walk through it together.

然后我们可以从 Minikube 开始，我们一起来看一下。
* start on 开始做
* walk through步行穿过; 〈非正〉轻而易举地通过; 马马虎虎地演

I've got the three different applications I'm gonna have to

download. These are all in the resources for this video and

we can start with just downloading Minikube.

我有三个不同的应用程序要下载。
这些都在本视频的资源中，
我们可以从下载 Minikube 开始。
* start with 以…开始

If you go to get started and you choose Windows and

you can download the installer here, you can also use

Chocolatey if you're a fancy administrator on Windows

and you know what Chocolatey is, but you can download the

installer.

如果你去开始，你选择 Windows，你可以在这里下载安装程序，
如果你是 Windows 的高级管理员，
你知道 Chocolatey 是什么，你也可以使用 Chocolatey，
你可以下载安装程序。

Same goes for VirtualBox.

VirtualBox 也是如此。

You can go to downloads than under Windows.

可以在 Windows 下下载。

You can choose download that file.

你可以选择下载那个文件。

And then under Kubernetes' website

where you would get kubectl because it's just a single

small little binary.

然后在 Kubernetes 的网站下，你会得到 kubectl，因为它只是一个小二进制。

You can see here install kubectl on Windows.

你可以在这里看到在 Windows 上安装 kubectl。

The trick with this one is it's going to let you download

it, but it's not always up-to-date.

这个的诀窍是它会让你下载它，但它并不总是最新的。
* trick n. 诡计；恶作剧；窍门；花招；骗局；欺诈

So here's what we have to do.

所以我们必须这样做。

We want to get the most current version of kubectl because

that's the command line tool you're gonna be using

throughout this course to talk to your cluster.

我们想要得到最新版本的 kubectl 
因为这是在整个课程中都要使用的命令行工具
来与你的集群通信。

So it doesn't necessarily require that we have

the latest version, but I want you to know how to get the

latest version on Windows.

所以它不一定要求我们有最新的版本，
但是我想让你知道如何在 Windows 上获得最新的版本。

Here, they're saying that you need to know what the latest

version is so you can open up that text file in a new tab,

and we can see here that the version

1.16.3 is the latest release when I recorded this video.

这里，他们说你需要知道最新的版本是什么，
这样你就可以在一个新标签页打开那个文本文件，
我们可以看到 1.16.3 版本是我录制这个视频时的最新版本。

We are going to download

the file and we can click here, but the problem

is these links aren't updated. They're sending us to the

1.16.0 release.

我们要下载文件，我们可以点击这里，
但问题是这些链接没有更新。
他们把我们送到 1.16.0 版本。

So what I want to do is I'm going to copy the link,

I'm going to open up a new tab, paste it in my browser

and then back up and change the version number

to the latest version in that text file.

所以我要做的是复制链接，打开一个新的标签，
粘贴到浏览器中，
然后备份并将版本号更改为文本文件中的最新版本。

Hopefully that makes sense. Then it's gonna download the

file and I'll have it locally on my machine.

希望这是有意义的。然后它会下载文件，我会把它放在我的机器上。

Now that I've got these three things in my downloads

folder, the one thing you definitely want to do with

kubectl is right click on it, go down

to properties, and click unblock.

现在我的下载文件夹中已经有了这三样东西，
你一定要做的一件事就是右键点击 kubectl，
向下到 properties，然后点击 unblock。

This is common of any zip file or any executable

you download. And this will prevent us from having

additional warnings in the future when we're trying to run

it.

这对于您下载的任何 zip 文件或任何可执行文件都很常见。
这将防止我们在未来运行它时得到额外的警告。
* in the future 今后

All right. Now you can install VirtualBox like you normally

would.

好吧。现在您可以像往常一样安装 VirtualBox 了。

And that'll give you several prompts for installing drivers

and ask you for administrative permissions, and if you've

already got a VirtualBox installed in your machine for

Docker Machine, you know, for Docker Toolbox, those tools,

you don't need to reinstall it.

这会给你几个安装驱动程序的提示，
并询问你是否有管理权限，
如果你已经在你的机器上安装了 Docker Machine 的 VirtualBox，
你知道，对于 Docker 工具箱，
这些工具，你不需要重新安装。
* prompt n.(给演员的)提词，提示;提示符
* administrative adj.管理的;行政的
* permission n.准许;许可;批准;许可证;书面许可

You might just want to make sure it's up to date, but you

don't have to have a different version.

你可能只是想确保它是最新的，但你不必有不同的版本。

There's nothing special about it.

这没什么特别的。

And then we're going to also run the Minikube installer.

然后我们还要运行 Minikube 安装程序。

Now, the Minikube installer simply puts the

Minikube utility inside your program

files and it doesn't connect

all the pieces together yet.

现在，Minikube 安装程序只是将 Minikube 实用程序放在程序文件中，
它还没有将所有的部分连接起来。

So the last piece of this puzzle is once that's installed,

we're going to open up PowerShell, just regular old

PowerShell.

最后一个问题是一旦安装完毕，
我们将打开PowerShell，
只是普通的旧PowerShell。

Not the ISC.

而不是 ISC。

You tend to not want to use the ISC or the x86

versions, you just want the Windows PowerShell.

您可能不想使用 ISC 或 x86 版本，您只想使用 Windows PowerShell。

And now that the Minikube setup is finished,

you can do the last piece of the puzzle, which is to get

kubectl installed, because once we try to run

Minikube, Minikube is going to create a VM,

install communities in it, and then it's going to setup the

kubectl command line to talk to it.

现在 Minikube 设置完成后, 
你可以做拼图的最后一块,这是让 kubectl 安装,
因为一旦我们试图运行 Minikube
Minikube 将创建一个虚拟机, 安装 communities,
然后设置 kubectl 命令行与它通信。

For me, I'm going to put it in a new tools

folder that I tend to have on all my Windows systems

anyway, and then I need to add that folder to my path.

对我来说，我会把它放在一个新的工具文件夹里，
不管怎样，我都会把它放在我所有的 Windows 系统上，
然后我需要把这个文件夹添加到我的 path 中。

This is what most installation programs do for you when

they put stuff in program files.

Since we don't have an installer for kubectl,

we've got to do this manually ourselves.

这是大多数安装程序在将内容放入程序文件时为您做的事情。
因为我们没有 kubectl 的安装程序，所以我们必须自己手动安装。

Makedir.

I'm going to put it in the root of C under tools.

我要把它放在 C 的根目录 tools 下。

Then I'm going to copy the

download file.

然后我要复制下载文件。

kubectl.

I'm going to copy that into the tools directory.

我要把它复制到工具目录中。

Then I should be able to a dir on tools

and see that kubectl.

然后我就可以直接在工具上看到 kubectl。

Now, since you've manually downloaded that, you're probably

going to want to check a couple of times a year to make

sure that you have the kubectl version.

现在，由于您已经手动下载了这个版本，
您可能需要每年检查几次以确保您拥有 kubectl 版本。

We'll talk later about compatibility, but generally,

kubectl can talk to clusters, either the same

minor version or one minor version out of date.

我们稍后将讨论兼容性，但通常，kubectl 可以与集群对话，
要么是同一个次要版本，要么是一个过时的次要版本。
* out of date adj.过时的;缺乏新信息的;陈腐的;失效的;过期的
* minor adj.较小的;次要的;轻微的;小调的;小音阶的
* compatibility n.和睦相处;并存;相容;(尤指计算机及程序的)兼容性，相容性

So a 1.16 can talk to a 1.14 or

a 1.17.

因此 1.16 可以与 1.14 或 1.17 通信。

Now, the other thing we need to do is we need to change our

path. If you just search for a path

inside of your Start menu, you should

be able to see this option that says Edit the system

environment variables. That's what we want to do.

现在，我们需要做的另一件事是改变我们的 path。
如果您只是在“开始”菜单中搜索一个路径，
那么您应该能够看到这个选项，
即“编辑系统环境变量”。这就是我们想做的。

We want to click under environment variables

and then find the path for the whole system.

Click, edit there and then we're going to add a new

location to the paths, and we're going to

add tools.

You can do this once. This can be a place you can put

whatever you want there.

You can also do stuff through Chocolatey.

You might even be able to install this through Chocolatey,

which is a package manager for Windows.

I'm not going to go through all of that because there's a

process to set up Chocolatey and a whole command line for

that. But, if you check that out, you might build the find

Minikube and kubectl on there.

In order to get our path, we need to close

our shell and reopen it so that our path will be updated.

I should be able to type kubectl and

it works.

I just typed the word kubectl and it returned stuff without

an error. That means that it can find the kubectl

in my tools folder.

The next step is for us to run the

Minikube setup.

That's minikube start.

This will take a few minutes. It'll need to download an ISO

file. It'll need to set up Kubernetes and all the different

containers. It's got some work to do.

It might take up to five minutes or more, maybe, depending

on the speed of your system.

I think on mine, it takes somewhere between three and five

minutes. You might even get some prompts

to set up drivers or ask for permissions.

A lot of this is Minikube talking to VirtualBox and

getting that connection set up properly.

Once you have this VM set up, you can

go in and change the CPUs and memory resources

inside of VirtualBox. This is just the default setup for

two CPUs and 2GBs of RAM.

So, Kubernetes, if it needs more than 2GBs of RAM, you'll

need to go into VirtualBox and give it.

The other thing is you'll need to learn some of the other

Minikube command lines.

There's other things in there like Minikube stop, which

will stop your Kubernetes server.

You can delete it. You can, you know, you can

create other ones. There's lots of options there.

Just type minikube and hit enter, and you'll see

different options at the command line.

You don't normally need to keep VirtualBox running, but you

can see here that I've got this Minikube and it's running

and installing the VirtualBox.

Now, this is the view of a successful

setup of Minikube.

If you've done the start command and you've gone eventually

through all these different steps, and you get to the

bottom and it says done, then it's

done its job. And it's technically added a config file in

your profile. So, if I type kubectl version, I

get back both the client and the server version, and it's

OK if they're a little bit different.

Then kubectl get nodes.

I could use kubectl get nodes. Then you see the Minikube

server that you're talking to.

This means it's running and you're good to go.

If you want to stop it for the day, make sure you remember

to do a minikube stop

and it won't delete the machine. It'll just stop it.

Or, you can go into VirtualBox and manually shut it down.

The last little thing here is if you happen to be on a

system where you get an error that says

this computer doesn't have VT-X or AMD-v enabled,

you need to enable virtualization in your computer bios.

That is because this is creating a virtual machine on top

of your windows OS.

If you have never use virtualization

before, you may need to go in your bios and turn it on.

It also might mean you're using a virtual Windows machine.

And that that virtual Windows machine cannot

use virtualization.

That's known as nested virtualization.

It's a little fancy, but not every virtualization

technology supports it.

So, if you're still trying to figure that one out, just

search nested virtualization for whatever

platform you're using your VM on.
