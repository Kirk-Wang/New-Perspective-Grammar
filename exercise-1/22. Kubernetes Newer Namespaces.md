We just talked about the three of the

namespaces in this list. The default, the Docker and the

kube-system. Particularly the kube-system, which is where

all the guts of Kubernetes control plane are living.

我们刚刚讨论了这个列表中的三个名称空间。
默认的 Docker 和 kube-system。
特别是 kube-system，
这是所有 Kubernetes control plane 的核心所在。
* gut 内脏，核心

But, there's these other two that we haven't mentioned.

但是，还有另外两个我们没有提到。

Let's just cover those real quick.

让我们快速讲一下。

The first one is kube-public.

第一个是 kube-public。

This one is really just used for installation

and then eventually, connecting to something.

这一个真的只是用于安装，然后最终，连接到一些东西。
* used for 用于

Let's take a look at it. We can see if there's anything in

there with the kubectl command.

我们来看看。我们可以使用 kubectl 命令查看其中是否有任何内容。

We can use the kubectl -n here to specify the

kube-public namespace.

我们可以在这里使用 kubectl -n 来指定 kube-public 名称空间。

Then, get pods. Let's try that.

然后, get pods。让我们试试。

There's no resources there. So, we don't have

any apps running in containers.

那里没有资源。我们没有在容器中运行任何应用。

So, what's it for? Well, this is done for

a couple of reasons.

那么，这是干什么的？好吧，这样做有几个原因。
* a couple of 一对

One is for bootstrapping the cluster.

一个是引导集群。

It's a little technical, but essentially it gives us

the data for how to connect.

这有点技术性，但本质上它为我们提供了如何连接的数据。

This introduces a new type of resource that we haven't

talked about, and we're not really going to talk about now.

It's called ConfigMaps.

这引入了一种新的资源类型，
我们还没有讨论过，
现在也不打算讨论。
它叫做 ConfigMaps。

Think of it as configuration files that then you

can get later in your apps.

把它当作配置文件，然后你可以在以后的应用程序中得到它。
* think of 记起，想起；考虑；想像；关心

You can actually connect these to your apps so that they'll

run in there as files.

实际上，你可以将这些连接到你的应用程序，这样它们就可以作为文件在其中运行。

We're just going to check this one out.

我们来看看这个。

It turns out that we can get this from inside the cluster,

and it gives us some interesting information on how to

connect. Let's type a kubectl namespace

kube-public get configmaps.

事实证明，我们可以从集群内部获得这些信息，
它为我们提供了一些关于如何连接的有趣信息。
让我们输入一个 kubectl 名称空间
kube-public get configmaps。
* turn out v.（以某种方式）发生；最后是，结果是；出席，参加，前去观看；关掉，熄灭（电灯、煤气等）；生产，制造

We see that we have one in here called cluster-info.

我们这里有一个叫 cluster-info 的。

We can pull this out and have it

shown to us in YAML.

我们可以把它拉出来，在 YAML 中显示出来。

Let's do that same thing.

We hit the up arrow and we're going to say get configmap

cluster -info with an output

of yaml. We're asking for this one ConfigMap

and please show us in YAML.

You'll see here, of course, it's in YAML format because we

asked for it. But, it's going to be specific information to

your environment. Since I'm on Docker Desktop, I'm

going to have information specific to my

server. It's the public certificate and information

here for how to connect to the server, specifically

the API. We're not going to use this right now.

But later, we're going to have lectures on context,

which is how you change the way you're connecting, whether

it's the user, or the cluster you're connecting to, or the

authentication you're using.

You can use that kubectl command.

It'd be cool for connecting between different clusters.

Lastly, let's talk about that kube-node-lease.

That's a namespace that really only has one purpose at this

point. It's a relatively new feature in Kubernetes that

allows an additional heartbeat from

the nodes back to the API.

We don't really mess with this much.

It's there, by default, as a part of the installation.

Just know that it's there.

Leave it alone. It should be working fine.
