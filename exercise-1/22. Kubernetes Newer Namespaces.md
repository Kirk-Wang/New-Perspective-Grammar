We just talked about the three of the

namespaces in this list. The default, the Docker and the

kube-system. Particularly the kube-system, which is where

all the guts of Kubernetes control plane are living.

But, there's these other two that we haven't mentioned.

Let's just cover those real quick.

The first one is kube-public.

This one is really just used for installation

and then eventually, connecting to something.

Let's take a look at it. We can see if there's anything in

there with the kubectl command.

We can use the kubectl -n here to specify the

kube-public namespace.

Then, get pods. Let's try that.

There's no resources there. So, we don't have

any apps running in containers.

So, what's it for? Well, this is done for

a couple of reasons.

One is for bootstrapping the cluster.

It's a little technical, but essentially it gives us

the data for how to connect.

This introduces a new type of resource that we haven't

talked about, and we're not really going to talk about now.

It's called ConfigMaps.

Think of it as configuration files that then you

can get later in your apps.

You can actually connect these to your apps so that they'll

run in there as files.

We're just going to check this one out.

It turns out that we can get this from inside the cluster,

and it gives us some interesting information on how to

connect. Let's type a kubectl namespace

kube-public get configmaps.

We see that we have one in here called cluster-info.

We can pull this out and have it

shown to us in YAML.

Let's do that same thing.

We hit the up arrow and we're going to say get configmap

cluster -info with an output

of yaml. We're asking for this one ConfigMap

and please show us in YAML.

You'll see here, of course, it's in YAML format because we

asked for it. But, it's going to be specific information to

your environment. Since I'm on Docker Desktop, I'm

going to have information specific to my

server. It's the public certificate and information

here for how to connect to the server, specifically

the API. We're not going to use this right now.

But later, we're going to have lectures on context,

which is how you change the way you're connecting, whether

it's the user, or the cluster you're connecting to, or the

authentication you're using.

You can use that kubectl command.

It'd be cool for connecting between different clusters.

Lastly, let's talk about that kube-node-lease.

That's a namespace that really only has one purpose at this

point. It's a relatively new feature in Kubernetes that

allows an additional heartbeat from

the nodes back to the API.

We don't really mess with this much.

It's there, by default, as a part of the installation.

Just know that it's there.

Leave it alone. It should be working fine.
