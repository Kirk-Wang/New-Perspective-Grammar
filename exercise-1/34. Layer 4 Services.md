One thing to remember about these services, as we get more

into them, is that they are a Layer 4

a concept.

That's OSI Layer 4.

That means that we can't just give a full IP address

with everything complete access.

When we specify these, we actually need to give it an IP

address, which we can give it a specific one if we want.

Then a protocol like TCP or UDP, and then

a port. Now there are a few ways around that

in case you have special requirements, but we're not going

to go down that road just yet because that's rather

advanced. Usually when you're dealing with stuff like cloud

services, or just distributed computing in general, you

don't typically need all ports and all protocols

on a raw IP for something like that.

There is hacks you can use to get around it.
