One thing to remember about these services, as we get more

into them, is that they are a Layer 4

a concept.

当我们深入了解这些服务时，
需要记住的一点是，
它们是第4层的概念。

That's OSI Layer 4.

这是 OSI 第 4 层。

That means that we can't just give a full IP address

with everything complete access.

这意味着我们不能只给一个完整的IP地址和所有的完全访问。

When we specify these, we actually need to give it an IP

address, which we can give it a specific one if we want.

当我们指定这些时，
我们实际上需要给它一个 IP 地址，
如果需要，
我们可以给它一个特定的 IP 地址。

Then a protocol like TCP or UDP, and then

a port. Now there are a few ways around that

in case you have special requirements, but we're not going

to go down that road just yet because that's rather

advanced. Usually when you're dealing with stuff like cloud

services, or just distributed computing in general, you

don't typically need all ports and all protocols

on a raw IP for something like that.

There is hacks you can use to get around it.
