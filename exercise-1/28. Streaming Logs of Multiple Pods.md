Let's go back to that logs command.

让我们回到 logs 命令。

Let's just see a little bit more about dealing with

multiple pods.

我们再看一下如何处理多个 pod。

In fact, let's try a logs command to see

if we can see the pingpong, which you should still

have running from a couple of lectures ago.

事实上，让我们尝试一个日志命令，
看看我们是否可以看到 pingpong，
你应该仍然有运行，来自前两节课之前。

That pingpong now has three replicas.

那个 pingpong 现在有三个副本。

Let's go see if we can get logs from all of them.

我们去看看能不能从他们那里得到日志。

kubectl logs.

We're going to use -l, which means a selector.

我们将使用 -l，这意味着一个选择器。

We haven't talked about selectors yet, but it's a way

to run commands against more than one

object based on labels.

我们还没有讨论选择器，
但它是一种基于标签对多个对象运行命令的方法。
* against 针对

So, we're going to use the -l, and the label we're going to

look for is run=pingpong, because

these containers are based upon the pingpong

deployment. So, we're going to run this

and we're going to add in --tail like before so we

don't get a huge amount of backlogs.

我们将使用 -l，
我们要查找的标签是 run=pingpong，
因为这些容器是基于 pingpong 部署的。
我们要运行这个，我们要加入，像之前那样的 --tail，
这样我们就不会有大量的积压。

Then we're going to use the -f, which is the short for

keep following the logs and stay attached to that stream,

right. What you'll notice here is because I know

our ping command only does one ping per second, you'll

probably notice that these are happening

about three a second, which means that we're probably

seeing all three of the pods.

然后我们要用 -f，
它是保持跟随日志并保持连接到那个流的缩写。
你会注意到的是因为我知道我们的 ping 命令每秒只执行一次 ping，
你可能会注意到这些大约每秒发生三次，
这意味着我们可能会看到所有三个 pod。

Pretty cool, right?

很酷,对吧?

Let's see what happens when we scale this up even more,

though, because there are limits to this command.

不过，让我们看看当我们进一步放大时会发生什么，因为这个命令是有限制的。
* even more 甚至更多
* though conj. 虽然，尽管, adv. 虽然；不过；然而

If we jump back and we scale up to eight,

we'll find out that there is a limit, by default,

to the number of pods we can stream the logs from

at the same time.

如果我们向后跳，并放大到8，
我们会发现，默认情况下，
可以同时从中传输日志的 pod 数量是有限制的。

I'll hit control c there and then kubectl

scale deployment pingpong replicas=8 this

time.

我在那里点击 control+c，然后这次
kubectl scale deployment pingpong replicas=8。

We'll give it a second.

我们等一下。

We can actually do a kubectl get

pods to see if we have eight running.

我们真的可以做一个 kubectl get pods，
看看我们是否有八个运行。

Yeah. We've got our sleep from before there

from the cron job, but we can see we've got all the

pingpong's there. That's what we care about.

是的。我们从以前的 cron job 中得到了 sleep，
但是我们可以看到我们得到了所有的 pingpong。
这就是我们关心的。

We're going to do kubectl logs -l

again, so it's the same command as before.

我们将再次使用 kubectl log -l，这是与之前相同的命令。

run=pingpong.

Tail it with one and then

follow. All right, now we're getting an error this

time saying you tried to follow 8 log streams

and you can only do 5.

Tail 使用 1, 然后尾随。
好吧，现在我们得到一个错误，
这一次说你试图跟踪8个日志流，
你只能做5个。

This is a setting that has changed recently

in Kubernetes configuration.

这是最近在 Kubernetes 配置中更改的设置。

This is all based around performance.

这都是基于性能的。

In the past, we wouldn't even

have this. You can actually see down at the bottom, we have

max log requests. We can use that to increase the limit.

在过去，我们甚至不会有这个。
你可以看到在底部，我们有最大日志请求。
我们可以用它来提高极限。

But why is this the case?

但为什么会这样呢?

Well, pulling logs is a rather strenuous

thing, especially if your apps are dumping

logs en masse.

好吧，拉日志是一件相当费劲的事情，
尤其是如果你的应用程序正在大量转储日志。
* rather strenuous 相当辛苦, 相当费劲
* strenuous adj.费力的;繁重的;艰苦的;劲头十足的;奋力的;顽强的
* en masse一起; 全体

If you're ever running a proxy or a web server,

and you're capturing every connection into logs, that's

a large amount of logs streaming over the network.

如果您曾经运行过代理或 web 服务器，
并将每个连接捕获到日志中，
那么网络上就会有大量的日志流。

Even if it's on just one machine, that

can be a lot of work for a computer.

即使只是在一台机器上，
对于一台计算机来说，这也可能是一项繁重的工作。

It's pulling this from the API.

这是从 API 中提取的。

So, if you think about how this connection is happening,

you're over here typing your kubectl command.

如果你考虑这个连接是如何发生的，
你在这里输入 kubectl 命令。
* over here 在这边; 到这边; 在身处国

That is being sent to the

API, running on the control plane.

它被发送给 API，在控制平面上运行。

Then that API needs to get the logs

from the pods.

然后那个API需要从pod获取日志。

Imagine if you had three,

different nodes all running different pods.

想象一下，如果你有三个不同的节点，运行不同的 pod。

Of course, in our setup here, we've only got it

on one machine probably.

当然，在我们的设置中，我们可能只有一台机器上有它。

But, if you had three nodes, that could

be happening and each one of these has the kubelet

agent running on it.

但是，如果你有三个节点，
这是可能发生的
每一个节点上都有 kubelet 代理在运行。

So, the API needs to make one connection

to each kubelet.

因此，API 需要为每个 kubelet 建立一个连接。

Then, that kubelet is going to look

at the pod and the container

logs in that pod.

然后，kubelet 会看到 pod 和 pod 里的容器日志。

But wait, there's more.

但是等等，还有更多。

What's technically happening here is it's not just one

connection. For each of these pods, there

are more connections happening.

从技术上讲，这不仅仅是一个连接。每一个 pod，都有更多的连接发生。

For each pod, there's a new connection coming out of

kubectl. Then, the API has

one connection to each kubelet.

对于每一个 pod，
都有一个新的连接从 kubelet 出来。
然后，API 与每个 kubelet 有一个连接。

So, we've got a lot of back and forth happening here,

and this could easily overwhelm your API.

所以，我们在这里有很多往返的事情发生，
这很容易会压倒你的 API。
* overwhelm v.(感情或感觉)充溢，难以禁受;压倒;击败;征服;压垮;使应接不暇

That's important for us to not do.

这对我们来说很重要。

We don't want to overwhelm the API.

我们不想压倒API。

It's the most precious thing in your cluster.

它是集群中最宝贵的东西。
* most precious 强调极少或太少; 珍奇的; 珍稀的; 宝贵的; 珍贵的; 受珍爱的; 被珍惜的; precious的最高级

So, you want to protect that, and there's a natural limit

here. You can change that limit, but there's probably

a better way. While we're here, let's just talk about

other shortcomings of the log command.

你想要保护它，这里有一个自然的限制。
你可以改变这个极限，但可能有更好的方法。
在这里，我们只讨论log命令的其他缺点。
* shortcoming  n.缺点;短处

I've listed them here.

我把它们列在这里了。

It's a lot of shortcomings.

有很多缺点。

There's no date timestamp or information about

which Pod sent that particular log line.

没有日期时间戳，也没有Pod发送特定日志行的信息。

If pods change by coming in and out, you know, being

replaced or deleted, they're not changed

in the command. It's only what was working at the time the

command started.

如果pod通过进出而改变，
你知道，被替换或删除，
它们在命令中不会改变。
这只是在命令启动时起作用的东西。
* at the time在一定时间；也；立即；毫不拖延地；在…期间

That command got kind of long, like having to write

all that stuff just to get the particular multi-pod

setup from one deployment was a little bit unnecessary.

Luckily, we have

external third-party tools.

The best one for this that I like right now is Stern.

Let's check that next.
