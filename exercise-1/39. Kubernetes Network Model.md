I

have some good and some bad news for you.

我有一些好消息和坏消息要告诉你。

It's all about networking in this

lecture. I'm going to describe some of the high level

concepts of how the networking model works in Kubernetes.

这节课都是关于网络的。我将描述一些关于 Kubernetes 中网络模型如何工作的高级概念。

The good news here is there is a lot of simplicity coming

out-of-the-box, and that is that there's

not a lot of ways you're allowed to add complexity here.

好消息是，开箱即用就提供了很多简单性，那就是，这里没有太多允许您增加复杂性的方法。

That can be a restriction sometimes when you're trying to

go across firewalls, or NAT layers, or different

data centers. That's why often people create clusters

that are just in one data center because of some of these

restrictions. You'll notice here that most of these talk

about that the nodes, and the pods, and everything there,

all need to be able to communicate with each other on a

big, flat network without NAT.

有时，当您尝试穿越防火墙，NAT层或其他数据中心时，这可能是一个限制。
这就是为什么人们经常由于某些限制而在一个数据中心中创建群集。
您会在这里注意到，其中大多数都是关于节点，pod 以及其中的所有内容，
所有这些都需要能够在没有 NAT 的大型扁平网络上相互通信。

You can have routing, but you

can't have translation. That's a good thing, because that

would just complicate things further.

你可以有路由，但不能有翻译。这是件好事，因为那样会使事情更复杂。

Often, whenever I'm dealing with someone's troubleshooting

on any of the container solutions, firewalls and NAT

are often part of the problem.

通常，每当我处理某人对任何容器解决方案的故障排除时，
防火墙和 NAT 常常是问题的一部分。

I've listed a bunch of good things here.

我在这里列出了很多好东西。

We've got, you can reach everything.

我们有，你可以接触到一切。

So, that's easy. There's no NAT.

所以，这很简单。没有 NAT。

There's no poor translation. There's no new, fancy

protocols required.

没有糟糕的翻译。 不需要新的花哨的协议。

There's no requirement that everything's in one IP

subnet. You can actually design it to where you maybe have

a subnet for each set of pods on different nodes so

that each node is its own subnet.

不要求所有内容都在一个 IP 子网中。
实际上，您可以将其设计为在不同节点上
为每组 pod 设置一个子网，
以便每个节点都是自己的子网。

It allows you to really be flexible with how you design the

subnetting in the networking here. But, that's where

things start to get tricky. The first up is that

everything, by default, can reach everything.

它允许您真正灵活地设计网络中的子网。
但是，这就是事情开始变得棘手的地方。
首先，默认情况下，所有东西都可以到达任何地方。

That's a big one.

We didn't have that necessarily before Kubernetes

where we would maybe put VLANs in or allow cloud

segments.

这是一个大问题。
在 Kubernetes 出现之前，我们不一定会有这样的情况，
在 Kubernetes 出现之前，我们可能会在其中放置 vlan 或允许云段。

So, this one's a little bit tricky to deal with.

所以，这个问题有点棘手。

The way that Kubernetes deals with this is it

allows you to use a network implementation by a third

party. That, we mentioned earlier, is one of the choices

you have to make for your production clusters.

Kubernetes 处理这个问题的方法是允许您使用第三方的网络实现。
我们前面提到过，这是您必须为生产集群做出的选择之一。

You have to decide which network implementation you're

going to use. There's over a dozen of them.

您必须决定要使用哪个网络实现。有十几个。

You might even recognize some of them that you've maybe

heard before, like Flannel, or Calico, or Kubenet.

您甚至可能会认出您以前听过的一些内容，例如 Flannel 或 Calico 或 Kubenet。

Well, they're all pros and cons.

他们各有利弊。
* pros and cons利弊; 优缺点

They each have its own set of features.

它们各有其特点。

I usually recommend that you go with a cloud built version

that maybe is provided by your cloud hoster or

a distribution of Kubernetes.

我通常建议您使用云托管版本，
该版本可能由您的云托管者或 Kubernetes 发行版提供。

All of those are going

to come out-of-the-box with their own preferences, which is both a

good and a bad thing.

所有这些都将根据自己的喜好即开即用，这既是好事也是坏事。
* preference n. 偏爱，倾向；优先权

The nice thing is for most people getting started is they

just don't want to have to get into the weeds of this yet.

对大多数人来说，刚开始做这件事是件好事，因为他们还不想卷入其中。

Let's just make it work out-of-the-box.

让我们直接使用它。

But, the reality is, eventually you're going to need to

care as you get closer and closer to production and as your

production gets bigger. So, there's no requirement here

that you have to know all this on day one. If it works for

you now in learning, great.

但是，事实是，当你越来越接近生产的时候，当你的生产越来越大的时候，你最终需要注意。
这里没有要求你必须在第一天就知道所有这些。如果它现在对你的学习有帮助，那就太好了。

As you build out your clusters, if

you're using someone else's distribution or Kubernetes that

they've provided, go with their defaults until you have

really hard requirements.

当您构建您的集群时，
如果您正在使用其他人提供的分发版或 Kubernetes，
请使用他们的默认设置，直到您遇到真正困难的需求。

We've mentioned about kube-proxy being a potential source

of limitation here. But, in practice, it's really not.

我们已经提到了 kube-proxy 是一个潜在的限制源。
但在实践中，事实并非如此。
* in practice 事实上;实际上
* being a 变成一个
* potential adj.潜在的;可能的

Usually, in most situations, you're

not saturating 10Gb networks. And if you are, you're

already probably diving into the weeds of networking in Kubernetes

anyway.

通常，在大多数情况下，10Gb 网络不会饱和。
如果你是，不管怎样，你可能已经深入到 Kubernetes 的网络杂草中了。

You're probably someone who knows a lot about container

networking, in general, more than the average person.

您可能非常了解容器网络，一般来说，比一般人多。

When Docker came out, Docker was designed to make

networking easier

and more accessible to the non Cisco gurus out there.

当 Docker 问世时，Docker 的设计是为了让网络变得更容易，让那些非思科专家更容易访问。

Those of us that don't have all the Cisco certifications

and networking certifications don't

necessarily need to know about all the details of switch

configuration. That's what's great about Docker and Kubernetes is they

generally just work out-of-the-box.

我们这些没有思科认证和网络认证的人不一定需要知道交换机配置的所有细节。
这就是 Docker 和 Kubernetes 的伟大之处，它们通常都是开箱即用的。

Any of the providers that you choose for networking

Kubernetes will work out-of-the-box, with a lot of cases,

if you're doing the generic upstream vanilla of

Kubernetes. Remember, I don't always recommend that, and in

fact, I really only recommend it for learning.

你选择的任何一个 Kubernetes 网络提供商，
如果你做的是 Kubernetes 的一般上游业务，
都会开箱即用，在很多情况下。
请记住，我并不总是建议这样做，
事实上，我只是建议用它来学习。

For all my production deployments, I would always recommend

a cloud provided or a custom

distribution from a vendor. You'll notice down there at the

bottom that I have listed kube-router. You

can check out that project. It's an interesting replacement

for kube-proxy.

对于我的所有生产部署，我总是建议使用云计算或来自供应商的自定义分发版。
你会注意到我在下面列出了 kube-router，你可以看看那个项目。
它是 kube-proxy 的一个有趣的替代品。

It has lots of benefits that they list there, but it's not

always needed. One of the challenges with Kubernetes is

everything seems to be so customizable that if

you kept customizing everything, eventually,

you would end up with a solution that only you could support. So,

他们在上面列出了很多好处，但并不总是需要。
Kubernetes 面临的挑战之一是，一切似乎都是可定制的，
如果你继续定制一切，
最终，你会得到一个只有你才能支持的解决方案。

I always encourage you to stick with the defaults as much

as possible to rein in your requirements and

limit the scope of those so that your solution is

looking more and more like all the other solutions out there, so

that you don't have a crazy, wild configuration that no one

else knows how it works.
