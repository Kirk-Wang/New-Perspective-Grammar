I

have some good and some bad news for you.

It's all about networking in this

lecture. I'm going to describe some of the high level

concepts of how the networking model works in Kubernetes.

The good news here is there is a lot of simplicity coming

out-of-the-box, and that is that there's

not a lot of ways you're allowed to add complexity here.

That can be a restriction sometimes when you're trying to

go across firewalls, or NAT layers, or different

data centers. That's why often people create clusters

that are just in one data center because of some of these

restrictions. You'll notice here that most of these talk

about that the nodes, and the pods, and everything there,

all need to be able to communicate with each other on a

big, flat network without NAT.

You can have routing, but you

can't have translation. That's a good thing, because that

would just complicate things further.

Often, whenever I'm dealing with someone's troubleshooting

on any of the container solutions, firewalls and NAT

are often part of the problem.

I've listed a bunch of good things here.

We've got, you can reach everything.

So, that's easy. There's no NAT.

There's no poor translation. There's no new, fancy

protocols required.

There's no requirement that everything's in one IP

subnet. You can actually design it to where you maybe have

a subnet for each set of pods on different nodes so

that each node is its own subnet.

It allows you to really be flexible with how you design the

subnetting in the networking here. But, that's where

things start to get tricky. The first up is that

everything, by default, can reach everything.

That's a big one.

We didn't have that necessarily before Kubernetes

where we would maybe put VLANs in or allow cloud

segments.

So, this one's a little bit tricky to deal with.

The way that Kubernetes deals with this is it

allows you to use a network implementation by a third

party. That, we mentioned earlier, is one of the choices

you have to make for your production clusters.

You have to decide which network implementation you're

going to use. There's over a dozen of them.

You might even recognize some of them that you've maybe

heard before, like Flannel, or Calico, or Kubenet.

Well, they're all pros and cons.

They each have its own set of features.

I usually recommend that you go with a cloud built version

that maybe is provided by your cloud hoster or

a distribution of Kubernetes.

All of those are going

to come out-of-the-box with their own preferences, which is both a

good and a bad thing.

The nice thing is for most people getting started is they

just don't want to have to get into the weeds of this yet.

Let's just make it work out-of-the-box.

But, the reality is, eventually you're going to need to

care as you get closer and closer to production and as your

production gets bigger. So, there's no requirement here

that you have to know all this on day one. If it works for

you now in learning, great.

As you build out your clusters, if

you're using someone else's distribution or Kubernetes that

they've provided, go with their defaults until you have

really hard requirements.

We've mentioned about kube-proxy being a potential source

of limitation here. But, in practice, it's really not.

Usually, in most situations, you're

not saturating 10Gb networks. And if you are, you're

already probably diving into the weeds of networking in Kubernetes

anyway.

You're probably someone who knows a lot about container

networking, in general, more than the average person.

When Docker came out, Docker was designed to make

networking easier

and more accessible to the non Cisco gurus out there.

Those of us that don't have all the Cisco certifications

and networking certifications don't

necessarily need to know about all the details of switch

configuration. That's what's great about Docker and Kubernetes is they

generally just work out-of-the-box.

Any of the providers that you choose for networking

Kubernetes will work out-of-the-box, with a lot of cases,

if you're doing the generic upstream vanilla of

Kubernetes. Remember, I don't always recommend that, and in

fact, I really only recommend it for learning.

For all my production deployments, I would always recommend

a cloud provided or a custom

distribution from a vendor. You'll notice down there at the

bottom that I have listed kube-router. You

can check out that project. It's an interesting replacement

for kube-proxy.

It has lots of benefits that they list there, but it's not

always needed. One of the challenges with Kubernetes is

everything seems to be so customizable that if

you kept customizing everything, eventually,

you would end up with a solution that only you could support. So,

I always encourage you to stick with the defaults as much

as possible to rein in your requirements and

limit the scope of those so that your solution is

looking more and more like all the other solutions out there, so

that you don't have a crazy, wild configuration that no one

else knows how it works.
