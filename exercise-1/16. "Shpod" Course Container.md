Throughout this course, we're going to be using lots of

tools besides the standard kubectl tool

that comes with Kubernetes.

在整个课程中，除了 Kubernetes 附带的标准 kubectl 工具外，我们还将使用许多其他工具。

The thing is that we're all going to be on different

operating systems, different versions of those systems,

different ways we all install packages.

问题是，我们都将在不同的操作系统上，这些系统的不同版本，安装软件包的不同方式。

And Kubernetes is way more complicated than just having

Docker. You know, there's lots of features and tools and

things we need. I'm going to give you a bunch of tools to

use that aren't the standard stuff.

Kubernetes比Docker要复杂得多。你知道，我们需要很多特性、工具和东西。我会给你们一些工具来使用，它们不是标准的东西。

So, how do we all make sure we have the same thing and have

all the right stuff that we need?

那么，我们如何确保我们拥有同样的东西，
并拥有我们需要的所有正确的东西呢?

The answer is a container to run in your Kubernetes

environment called shpod or "sh-pod."

答案是一个在 Kubernetes 环境中运行的容器，称为 shpod 或 “sh-pod”。

I'm going to say shpod throughout the course.

我将在整个课程中使用shpod。

So, when I point that out on a slide or I mention shpod,

you can come back to this.

所以，当我在幻灯片上指出这一点或者我提到shpod，你可以回到这个。

There's actually a quick link to this in

the resources for this video. It's essentially the website

slides.kubernetesmastery.com.

在这个视频的参考资料中有一个指向这个的快速链接。基本上是 slides.kubernetesmatery.com 网站。

And then #shpod will

get you right back to this screen. Then you can run these

commands, and the first one will set up the container,

which doesn't do anything but sit there and wait for you to

get attached to it.

然后 #shpod 会让你回到这个屏幕。然后您可以运行这些命令，第一个命令将设置容器，容器除了坐在那里等待您连接到它之外什么也不做。

The second command here will attach to that container, and

it gives you a shell inside the cluster with some

standard Linux tools that we will use throughout

the course. And this means that even if you're

on windows and you have PowerShell, you can jump in here

and have a bash interface

with the same experience that I'm going to be showing you.

So, this is important and something you should remember throughout

the course.

Personally, if I was taking this course, I would run the

create command once at the very beginning, like now, even

though I don't know what it's for. And if you're not

certain, go look at that YAML file.

It installs an image and

you can even go check out that image and go find it on Docker Hub

by using the name. And just in case you're security

conscious and I applaud you for that.

So, you can go check that out to make sure it's not doing

anything nefarious. But, that will run a

container on your cluster, and it will just sit there in

the background. I would leave that running for the whole

course. While the Kubernetes running, Just keep that

running. And then you can jump in and out with the attach

command. Whenever you're done with the attach command, you

can just type exit and you leave the shell.

Then when you're done with the course, or maybe you're

going to put the course on pause for a while, and

this will delete all the resources that the YAML file has

created and it won't leave a trace. It essentially cleans

up after itself.

Hopefully, this will make your experience very similar to

what I'm using in the examples.
