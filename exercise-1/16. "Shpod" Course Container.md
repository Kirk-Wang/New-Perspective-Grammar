Throughout this course, we're going to be using lots of

tools besides the standard kubectl tool

that comes with Kubernetes.

The thing is that we're all going to be on different

operating systems, different versions of those systems,

different ways we all install packages.

And Kubernetes is way more complicated than just having

Docker. You know, there's lots of features and tools and

things we need. I'm going to give you a bunch of tools to

use that aren't the standard stuff.

So, how do we all make sure we have the same thing and have

all the right stuff that we need?

The answer is a container to run in your Kubernetes

environment called shpod or "sh-pod."

I'm going to say shpod throughout the course.

So, when I point that out on a slide or I mention shpod,

you can come back to this.

There's actually a quick link to this in

the resources for this video. It's essentially the website

slides.kubernetesmastery.com.

And then #shpod will

get you right back to this screen. Then you can run these

commands, and the first one will set up the container,

which doesn't do anything but sit there and wait for you to

get attached to it.

The second command here will attach to that container, and

it gives you a shell inside the cluster with some

standard Linux tools that we will use throughout

the course. And this means that even if you're

on windows and you have PowerShell, you can jump in here

and have a bash interface

with the same experience that I'm going to be showing you.

So, this is important and something you should remember throughout

the course.

Personally, if I was taking this course, I would run the

create command once at the very beginning, like now, even

though I don't know what it's for. And if you're not

certain, go look at that YAML file.

It installs an image and

you can even go check out that image and go find it on Docker Hub

by using the name. And just in case you're security

conscious and I applaud you for that.

So, you can go check that out to make sure it's not doing

anything nefarious. But, that will run a

container on your cluster, and it will just sit there in

the background. I would leave that running for the whole

course. While the Kubernetes running, Just keep that

running. And then you can jump in and out with the attach

command. Whenever you're done with the attach command, you

can just type exit and you leave the shell.

Then when you're done with the course, or maybe you're

going to put the course on pause for a while, and

this will delete all the resources that the YAML file has

created and it won't leave a trace. It essentially cleans

up after itself.

Hopefully, this will make your experience very similar to

what I'm using in the examples.
