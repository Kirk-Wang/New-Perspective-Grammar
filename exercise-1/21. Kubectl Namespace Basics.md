We just ran a get pods command.

我们刚刚运行了一个get pods命令。

We saw no pods and it told us there were no pods in the

default namespace.

But, what does namespace mean and why don't we see all

those containers that are running our cluster?

We know we have etcd, and the api, and a bunch

of other things running, but we don't see them there.

That's because namespaces are filtering

the view, by default.

So, we don't get to see all the containers.

If we do a kubectl get namespaces, we

see there's definitely more than a few, right?

It turns out that when you start out with a cluster,

you're seeing the default namespace.

When you do a certain set of the commands, it's not all

commands that filter by namespace, but

the commands we're using right now, use the namespace.

Think of it like a filter as a way to only

show you what you need to be concerned with.

When you deploy Kubernetes in most installation types,

it puts all the system stuff into the kube-system

namespace. But, that's not the one you see.

The one you're normally going to see is default.

Because in most cases, we don't care about

the servers that run this thing, right.

We're focused on our apps. We're focused on our

deployments. So, that's why it's filtering out a lot of

this other stuff that's maybe of only interest to

a System Administrator or somebody managing the cluster.

In case you were paying attention earlier, you would have

seen when we did the describe node, you would have seen

these namespaces and the kube-system namespace there.

We didn't talk about it then.

Let's talk about what's in there.

If we go back to that command line and we type

--all-namespaces as

an option to the end of our command,

it will show us everything regardless of namespace.

This is a handy way to see everything across every

namespace because you can create as many namespaces as you

want. But, there are specific ones out-of-the-box for

managing the system.

get pods --all-namespaces.

In recent versions of Kubernetes, we could have also used

the -A, but I'm used to the old

way of doing it, and this still works.

The full all-namespaces command.

You'll see here a bunch of stuff.

If you're on Docker Desktop, the first two are in their own

special namespace called Docker.

Those are known as Compose on

Kubernetes, which is a feature of Docker that allows you to

actually deploy Compose files directly to Kubernetes

cluster. Pretty neat thing.

We'll talk about it later. But, if you're not on Docker

Desktop, it's not automatically there, although you can

install it yourself.

We're focused more on the stuff down at the bottom here,

the kube-system.

This is all the stuff we talked about.

The API, the proxy, the controller manager.

You'll see that we have CoreDNS here managing our DNS.

Of course, we got our database and the scheduler.

These are all the standard parts.

Just as a refresher one more time, because you'll

see me reminding you every so often of these critically

important components.

Here's a nice list showing you what's essential

out-of-the-box. One that you'll notice is missing here

is the sixth bullet, the

net name.

That one there is special.

That's not always going to be seen, but it is

often necessary, especially on production servers where

you've got multi server setups.

That is the network choice you're making.

We'll get into all the different options of network layers.

But, if you were to use something like Weave Net there

as your network overlay, then you would see containers for

managing Weave Net. If you see something like kube-dns,

then that may be something that remains

of an old installation.

Because nowadays with modern versions of Kubernetes

starting with 1.11, we use CoreDNS

as our DNS provider. It's a different project than the now

Legacy kube-dns.

You might see some remnants of the name around in certain

metadata on Docker Desktop or other systems.

Just know that one now replaces

the other. Of course, we can do lots of other things with

namespaces. We can change our default namespace.

We can filter each command to different namespaces, not

just all or the one we're in.

Let's do that now.

If you do kubectl get pods,

-n for namespace and kube-system, we

will see then the pods of that kube-system namespace.

For now, just think of namespaces as a filter.

It might be used when you want to deploy the same

application multiple times.

You could create different namespaces and have

the same pods and the same deployments.

That's something that you might use namespaces for.

Maybe if you're in a multi-administrator system, you might

create different namespaces for different people to manage

and set up fancy permissions for that.

You can also use namespaces with network policies to

control the network layer, but we're going to get into all

of that later. For now, just know that namespaces are

a thing and by default, you're only seeing default.

In case you're curious on some of the different parts of

namespaces, most commands can use a

namespace option on the end of them to either show you all

namespaces or filter to just one namespace.

You can also use the delete and label commands

against namespaces as well.

There's a little bit of inconsistency, but that's just

because namespaces aren't universal.

They don't apply to everything in the system, but they are

common.
