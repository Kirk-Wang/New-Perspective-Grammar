We just ran a get pods command.

我们刚刚运行了一个get pods命令。

We saw no pods and it told us there were no pods in the

default namespace.

我们没有看到 pods，它告诉我们在默认名称空间中没有 pods。

But, what does namespace mean and why don't we see all

those containers that are running our cluster?

但是，名称空间是什么意思?为什么我们看不到运行集群的所有容器?

We know we have etcd, and the api, and a bunch

of other things running, but we don't see them there.

我们知道我们有 etcd, api，
和一些其他的东西在运行，但是我们没有看到它们。

That's because namespaces are filtering

the view, by default.

这是因为默认情况下，命名空间正在过滤视图。
* by default 自动地

So, we don't get to see all the containers.

所以，我们不能看到所有的容器。

If we do a kubectl get namespaces, we

see there's definitely more than a few, right?

如果我们使用 kubectl get namespaces，
我们会看到名称空间肯定不止几个，对吧?

It turns out that when you start out with a cluster,

you're seeing the default namespace.

事实证明，当您开始使用集群时，您看到的是默认的名称空间。
* turn out v. （以某种方式）发生；最后是，结果是；出席，参加，前去观看；关掉，熄灭（电灯、煤气等）；生产，制造
* start out 出发；着手进行

When you do a certain set of the commands, it's not all

commands that filter by namespace, but

the commands we're using right now, use the namespace.

当您执行一组特定的命令时，
并不是所有的命令都按名称空间过滤，
但是我们现在使用的命令都使用名称空间。
* certain
  * adj. 某一；必然的；确信；无疑的；有把握的
  * pron. 某些；某几个

Think of it like a filter as a way to only

show you what you need to be concerned with.

把它想象成一个过滤器，作为一种只向你展示你需要关注的东西的方式。
* be concerned with 参与，干预；关心；相干；涉及

When you deploy Kubernetes in most installation types,

it puts all the system stuff into the kube-system

namespace. But, that's not the one you see.

当您在大多数安装类型中部署 Kubernetes 时，
它将所有系统内容放入 kube-system 名称空间。
但是你看到的不是这个。

The one you're normally going to see is default.

你通常会看到的是默认值。

Because in most cases, we don't care about

the servers that run this thing, right.

因为在大多数情况下，我们不关心运行这个东西的服务器，对吧。

We're focused on our apps. We're focused on our

deployments. So, that's why it's filtering out a lot of

this other stuff that's maybe of only interest to

a System Administrator or somebody managing the cluster.

我们专注于我们的应用程序。
我们专注于部署。
所以，这就是为什么它过滤掉了很多其他的东西，
这些东西可能只是系统管理员或管理集群的人感兴趣的。

In case you were paying attention earlier, you would have

seen when we did the describe node, you would have seen

these namespaces and the kube-system namespace there.

如果您之前注意过，
那么在我们进行描述节点时，
您会看到这些名称空间
和 kube-system 名称空间。
* in case conj. 万一；假使

We didn't talk about it then.

我们那时没谈过。

Let's talk about what's in there.

我们来谈谈里面有什么。

If we go back to that command line and we type

--all-namespaces as

an option to the end of our command,

it will show us everything regardless of namespace.

如果我们返回到命令行并键入 --all-namespaces 
作为命令末尾的一个选项，
它将显示所有内容，
而不管名称空间如何。
* go back to 回到
* regardless of prep.不管;不顾;不理会

This is a handy way to see everything across every

namespace because you can create as many namespaces as you

want. But, there are specific ones out-of-the-box for

managing the system.

这是一种方便的方法，
可以跨每个名称空间查看所有内容，
因为您可以创建任意多的名称空间。
但是，对于管理系统来说，
有一些是现成的。

get pods --all-namespaces.

In recent versions of Kubernetes, we could have also used

the -A, but I'm used to the old

way of doing it, and this still works.

The full all-namespaces command.

You'll see here a bunch of stuff.

If you're on Docker Desktop, the first two are in their own

special namespace called Docker.

Those are known as Compose on

Kubernetes, which is a feature of Docker that allows you to

actually deploy Compose files directly to Kubernetes

cluster. Pretty neat thing.

We'll talk about it later. But, if you're not on Docker

Desktop, it's not automatically there, although you can

install it yourself.

We're focused more on the stuff down at the bottom here,

the kube-system.

This is all the stuff we talked about.

The API, the proxy, the controller manager.

You'll see that we have CoreDNS here managing our DNS.

Of course, we got our database and the scheduler.

These are all the standard parts.

Just as a refresher one more time, because you'll

see me reminding you every so often of these critically

important components.

Here's a nice list showing you what's essential

out-of-the-box. One that you'll notice is missing here

is the sixth bullet, the

net name.

That one there is special.

That's not always going to be seen, but it is

often necessary, especially on production servers where

you've got multi server setups.

That is the network choice you're making.

We'll get into all the different options of network layers.

But, if you were to use something like Weave Net there

as your network overlay, then you would see containers for

managing Weave Net. If you see something like kube-dns,

then that may be something that remains

of an old installation.

Because nowadays with modern versions of Kubernetes

starting with 1.11, we use CoreDNS

as our DNS provider. It's a different project than the now

Legacy kube-dns.

You might see some remnants of the name around in certain

metadata on Docker Desktop or other systems.

Just know that one now replaces

the other. Of course, we can do lots of other things with

namespaces. We can change our default namespace.

We can filter each command to different namespaces, not

just all or the one we're in.

Let's do that now.

If you do kubectl get pods,

-n for namespace and kube-system, we

will see then the pods of that kube-system namespace.

For now, just think of namespaces as a filter.

It might be used when you want to deploy the same

application multiple times.

You could create different namespaces and have

the same pods and the same deployments.

That's something that you might use namespaces for.

Maybe if you're in a multi-administrator system, you might

create different namespaces for different people to manage

and set up fancy permissions for that.

You can also use namespaces with network policies to

control the network layer, but we're going to get into all

of that later. For now, just know that namespaces are

a thing and by default, you're only seeing default.

In case you're curious on some of the different parts of

namespaces, most commands can use a

namespace option on the end of them to either show you all

namespaces or filter to just one namespace.

You can also use the delete and label commands

against namespaces as well.

There's a little bit of inconsistency, but that's just

because namespaces aren't universal.

They don't apply to everything in the system, but they are

common.
