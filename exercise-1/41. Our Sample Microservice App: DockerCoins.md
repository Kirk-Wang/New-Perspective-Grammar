Now we

come to the time to learn about the application we'll be using throughout

a large portion of this course.

现在我们来学习我们将在本课程的大部分时间使用的应用程序。
* portion n. 部分；一份；命运
* Now we come to the time to 现在我们到了该……的时候了

What's it going to be?

会是什么？

What do you think? Any bets?

你怎么认为？有下注吗？

Bet you didn't think it was going to be a DockerCoin miner.

我打赌你没想到这会是一个 DockerCoin miner。

That's a new one, isn't it? My friend, Jerome, he

built up this system a long time ago.

那是一个新的，不是吗？ 我的朋友杰罗姆（Jerome）很久以前就建立了这个系统。
* a new one 全新的东西
* a long time ago 很久以前; 悠远

Actually, 2015, before Kubernetes was ever invented.

实际上，是 2015 年，在 Kubernetes 被发明之前。

You can't do anything with these coins

other than earn my respect.

除了赢得我的尊敬，你不能用这些硬币做任何事。
* earn vt. 赚，赚得；获得，挣得；使得到；博得
* other than除了…以外

But, it's similar in the idea of maybe

something like a Bitcoin miner.

但是，这种想法类似于比特币矿工的想法。
* something like 大约; 左右; 接近

But, we're not doing bitcoins here.

但是，我们这里不做比特币。

This isn't anything really like a ledger with all of

the actual cryptocurrency stuff in the background.

这并不是一个真正的以所有加密货币为背景的分类账。
* not anything 什么也没有

This is really about spreading out a couple of workloads

into different microservices and then doing

something with it, storing in a database and then showing

some stats about it. This is made up of five,

main parts. Let's go through those one at a time.

这实际上是将一些工作负载分散到不同的微服务中，
然后对其进行处理，
将其存储在数据库中，
然后显示关于它的一些统计信息。
它由五个主要部分组成。
让我们一次过一个。
* a couple of 三两个…；一对…
* spread out 展开；铺开；伸张
* made up of 由…组成
* one at a time 每次一个

Then we'll look at a network diagram, and then we'll get to

it. We start with the rng.

然后我们会看一个网络图，然后我们会讲到它。我们从 rng 开始。
* network diagram 网络图
* look at 看; 考虑
* get to 开始; 到达，抵达; 抓住；接触，和…取得联系
* start with 以…开始

That's the random number generator.

这就是随机数生成器。

That's its own little microservice. Then we have the

hasher. The hasher does what you

think it does. It hashes the random number.

这是它自己的小微服务。
然后我们有了 hasher。
hasher 做你认为它做的事。
它对随机数进行哈希运算。
* random number 随机数

Then we have the worker, which is doing all

of the orchestration. That's the wrong word there. We shouldn't

use that. Not orchestration.

然后是 worker，它执行所有的编排。
这个词用错了。
我们不应该用它。没有编排。

It's doing all of the handling of the work.
它正在处理所有工作。

It's handling the different communications.
它处理不同的通信。

It's the worker. Then we have the webui, which we

will be staring at on occasion to look at the performance

of our DockerCoin miner. Then we have redis.

它是 worker。
然后我们有 webui，
我们有时会盯着它看 DockerCoin miner 的性能。
然后我们有 redis。

That's where we'll be storing the results of our hashing.

这是我们存储哈希结果的地方。

Then we'll be using those as a way to check

performance and to make sure that our system is working.

然后，我们将使用这些作为一种方式来检查性能，并确保我们的系统是工作的。

The reason we're doing this type of application, it

might seem kind of unusual, is

because it has two things that are interesting about it. One is that every part of this is

isolated, and technically each one of these is in a

different programming language.

我们使用这种类型的应用程序的原因
可能看起来有点不寻常，
因为它有两个有趣的地方。
一个是这一切的每一部分都是孤立的，
从技术上讲，每一部分都用不同的编程语言。
* seem vi. 似乎；像是；装作
* kind of 有点儿；有几分
* unusual adj. 不寻常的；与众不同的；不平常的
* isolated adj. 偏远的；孤立的；孤独的；单独的； 绝缘的
* each one 一一；各人

Then the second part of this is that it's always doing

work. It's kind of boring to check an orchestration

system like Kubernetes when your

然后第二部分就是它总是在工作。
当应用程序没有在后台执行任何操作时，
检查像 Kubernetes 这样的编排系统有点无聊。

application isn't doing anything in the background. The

thing about real Bitcoin miners is that they're

constantly doing work. That's the whole point. They're maximizing

resources in IO to try to get as much out

of the system to mine those coins.

关于真正的比特币矿工，他们一直在工作。
这就是问题的关键。
他们最大限度地利用 IO 的资源，
试图从系统中获得尽可能多的
资源来开采这些金币。
* maximizing v. 使…最大化；取…最大值（maximize的ing形式）
* constantly adv. 不断地；时常地

But in this case, we're mining these DockerCoins, which

again, are only good for my

admiration and respect if you make a whole lot of them.

但在这种情况下，我们正在挖掘这些 DockerCoins，
如果你大量地制造它们，这对我的钦佩和尊重是有好处的。
* admiration n.钦佩;赞赏;羡慕

But, we're going to be doing that.

但是，我们会这样做。

It's going to be running in the background and generating

the DockerCoins for us to look at the logs, and the

它将在后台运行并生成DockerCoins，以供我们查看日志、流量和性能。

traffic, and the performance. The way

this thing works in terms of business workflow, if

this was a business, would be the worker reaching

out to the rng microservice, getting back this

random number that the rng generates.

它在业务工作流方面的工作方式是，
如果这是一个业务，
那么工作人员将接触到 rng 微服务，
获取 rng 生成的随机数。
* in terms of 在…方面;从…角度看;根据…来说

Then it takes that number, sends it off to the harsher.

The hasher hashes it, sends back the

result. Then the worker stores that inside the redis

database. Then it just keeps doing that as fast as it can.

然后它接收这个数字，把它发送给 harsher。
hasher对它进行哈希运算，然后返回结果。
然后 worker 将其存储在 redis 数据库中。
然后它会尽可能快地继续这样做。

The webui will be for us, the administrator,

to check the performance of our DockerCoin mining.

webui将为我们，管理员，检查我们的 DockerCoin 挖掘的性能。

This is a pretty simple, but effective, diagram

of this application.

这是一个非常简单但有效的应用程序图。

We are using all HTTP REST calls here.

我们在这里使用所有 HTTP REST 调用。

For the rng hasher, we're

talking in gets and posts. With redis, we're doing the

redis protocol to send the data to redis.

对于 rng hasher，我们在 get 和 post 中进行通信。
使用 redis，我们使用 redis protocol 将数据发送给 redis。

Then our webui is reaching out to redis to

check how many things

have been mined per second and giving us a nice little

然后，我们的 webui 会与 redis 进行联系，
以检查每秒挖掘了多少东西，
并为我们提供了一个不错的小图。
* reach out to 把手伸向，接触

graph of that. You might wonder in

Kubernetes how these things are communicating with each

other. The answer there is that they're communicating the

same way we've known all along.

在 Kubernetes 中，
您可能想知道这些东西是如何相互通信的。
答案是，
他们的交流方式和我们一直
以来所知道的是一样的。
* all along 一直

That's with service names. When you were in Docker

containers back with Docker networks, we

had not necessarily service names, but they were container

names on bridge networks.

那是服务名称。
当您在 Docker 容器中使用 Docker networks 时，
我们不一定有服务名称，
但它们是网桥网络上的容器名称。

Then if you ever played around with Docker Compose or

Swarm, those were services.

然后，如果您曾经玩过 Docker Compose 或 Swarm，那就是服务。

We called them that. They all operated on the

names of the services, similar to the name of the container

in regular old Docker run.

我们这样称呼他们。
它们都是根据服务的名称进行操作的，
类似于常规的旧 Docker 运行中的容器名称。
* similar to 与…类似

Here in Kubernetes, we have services that again, present

us with nice, friendly DNS hostnames.

在 Kubernetes，我们有一些服务，它们会向我们提供友好的 DNS 主机名。

Those are stored in CoreDNS and

it's delivering up the results like a DNS server should.

它们存储在CoreDNS中，它像DNS服务器一样传递结果。
* deliver up 交出，放弃

In our application source code, which

again is different languages for each part of the app, we

hardcode the names in here.

在我们的应用程序源代码
（对于应用程序的每个部分来说，语言也是不同的语言）中，
我们在此处对名称进行硬编码。

This is technically bad practice, right?

这在技术上是不好的做法，对吧?

If you've ever looked back at Twelve-Factor, you know that

in general terms, we're supposed to use environment

variables, or some sort of configuration, to then present

to each app the names for the other parts of the app.

如果你回顾过 Twelve-Factor，
你就会知道，一般来说，
我们应该使用环境变量，或者某种配置，
然后向每个应用程序
显示应用程序其他部分的名称。
* in general terms 概括地；一般地说

This is just a demo app, of course, so we can't do

all the things at once to show you how Kubernetes works.

当然，这只是一个演示应用程序，
所以我们不能同时做所有事情来
向您展示 Kubernetes 是如何工作的。

The funny thing here is that it doesn't matter where this

app runs.

有趣的是，这个应用程序在哪里运行并不重要。

We were running this app in 2015 in Docker Compose

and Docker run. We were running this in 2016 in

Swarm.

我们于2015年在 Docker Compose 和 Docker run 中运行了此应用程序。
我们在2016年在 Swarm 中运行了它。

Now here in 2018, 2019 and beyond, we're running it in

Kubernetes, and we haven't changed any of this.

现在，在 2018 年、2019 年以及以后的时间里，
我们在 Kubernetes 运行它，我们没有改变任何一点。

These names have been in the source code.

这些名称已经在源代码中。

If you go all the way back through the get log, all the way

back to 2015 before we ever had orchestration.

如果你一路回溯到 get log，一路回溯到 2015 年，我们有编排之前。

Because we always had in containers, the idea

that on a single applications network,

at the different parts of the application can find each

other by their friendly service names.

因为我们总是在容器中，
在单一的应用程序网络中，
在应用程序的不同部分可以通过友好的服务名称找到彼此。

So, I'm going to leave it up to you to decide whether you

ever want to hardcode things in like this.

In here, I generally still use environment

variables. That way I can change the names of things just

in case. But, with the flexibility of Kubernetes, you

might argue that you can create these services and have

them point to different backends whenever you'd like.

So, they don't really have to be the same name and DNS,

but who cares? For now, let's just stick with the names

hardcoded in the application.

That's how the parts find each other.

Which means we're going to have to have services for the

different parts to talk.

We'll all see the UI in a minute once we launch this

application.

It's designed by us backend developers.

It's not a really good frontend. It's crap.

It's not good.

You would not use this as a way to make a pretty graph on a

website. Trust me.

We didn't really make this for that purpose.

We're orchestration administrators right now.

We're playing the role of Kubernetes Ops.

We don't really care about the frontend fanciness or the

accuracy to the milliseconds.

We just want a nice UI to tell us how many per

second, on average, we're mining, and to make

sure that the server's working.
