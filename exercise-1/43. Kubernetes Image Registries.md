Before we get to running our app in Kubernetes,

let's take a quick moment about registries.

在我们开始在 Kubernetes 中运行我们的应用程序之前，
让我们快速地看一下注册表。

Registries in Kubernetes

are not something built in. Spoiler.

Kubernetes 中的注册表不是内置的。剧透。

There's no registry in Kubernetes, by default.

默认情况下，Kubernetes 中没有注册表。

In fact, it's not designed to be a

building engine either.

事实上，它也不是一个构建引擎。

If you remember from Docker, Docker was all about build,

ship, run, right.

如果你还记得 Docker 的话，
Docker 就是关于 build，ship，run 的，对吧。

If you have Docker locally on your machine, you can do all

of those things. You can push and pull images. You can

build images. You can rename images by tagging

them a different name. All that stuff.

如果你的机器上有 Docker，你可以做所有这些事情。
您可以 push 和 pull 镜像。
您可以构建镜像。
您可以通过标记不同的名称来重命名镜像。
所有的东西。

But, with Kubernetes, it's not doing that out-of-the-box.

但是，对于 Kubernetes 来说，它并不是开箱即用的。

Technically, if you have Kubernetes running on top of

Docker, you can still run Docker commands on those servers.

从技术上讲，如果你在 Docker 上面运行 Kubernetes，
你仍然可以在那些服务器上运行 Docker 命令。
* on top of 在…之上; 逼近; 胜任; 掌握

But, if you're using a different one like Containerd, or

CRI-O as your runtime, those don't

necessarily have building features in them.

但是，如果您使用不同的容器，
如 Containerd 或 CRI-O 作为您的运行时，
它们不一定具有构建特性。

Docker is the most feature rich runtime, but

it's also doing more than what Kubernetes is meant to do.

Docker 是功能最丰富的运行时，但它所做的还比 Kubernetes 要做的更多。

The point here is that we are needing to pull

images into our cluster.

这里的重点是我们需要将镜像拉入集群。

Can't build them there.

无法在那里构建它们。

We need to pull them from a registry. A registry is

the way you want to get stuff into Kubernetes.

我们需要把它们从注册表中取出来。
注册表是你想把东西放进 Kubernetes 的方式。

Just in case you need a refresher on how registries

work on the backend, when you do a docker run, which is

also what Kubernetes is doing when it's drilling

down into the kubelet and then down into the container

runtime, it's essentially doing a docker run with a

bunch of fancy stuff on it. But, it's doing that, and then

it's saying, OK, you've given me the Alpine image.

You said Alpine. Let me go look that up.

如果你需要一个关于注册表如何在后台工作的更新，
当你运行 docker 时，
这也是 Kubernetes 在深入到 kubelet，
然后深入到容器运行时所做的，
它实际上是在运行 docker，
上面有一堆有趣的东西。

Well, I'm going to expand that because the Alpine is

an official image, which in registry terms means

it's a library image, or a root image, where

it'll expand it to the term library.

好吧，我要扩展它，因为 Alpine 是一个官方 image，
在 registry 中，它意味着它是一个库 image，
或者根 image，在这里它将扩展到术语库。

Then it will expand that out because Docker is the default

registry on the Internet.

因为 Docker 是 Internet 上的默认 registry，所以它会将其扩展。

So, it'll expand that out to

index.docker.io/library/alpine.

所以，它将把它扩展到 index.docker.io/library/alpine。

Then, it has to figure out the tag, so

it will put :latest on there if

you haven't given it a tag already. Spoiler. You should

always give production images their own tag.

然后，它必须找出标签，如果你还没有给它一个标签，
它会把 :latest 放在那里。剧透。
你应该总是给产品 image 自己的标签。

You have here at the example in

the bottom where maybe on the first line we're doing a

docker pull on a GCR.

在下面的例子中，也许在第一行，我们在 GCR 上做 docker pull。

That's Google's registry.

那是谷歌的 registry。

We can do that somewhere there.

我们可以在那里做。

We can also build with Docker and call it something else on

your own custom registry and then push it up to your

in-house registry that you could technically run on

Kubernetes. That's fine. But, Kubernetes, itself, isn't

the registry. It's not a built-in feature, and

it's also not the image builder.

我们也可以用 Docker 构建，
并在你自己的自定义注册表中调用它，
然后把它推到你的内部 registry 中，
你可以在 Kubernetes 上运行它。
这很好。但是，Kubernetes 本身并不是 registry。
它不是一个内置功能，也不是 image 生成器。

What should you do here? If this

is such a critical part of getting images and applications

into your Kubernetes clusters, what choices do

we have here? Well, with building, you typically

would maybe start out, if you're just one person building

stuff locally on your machine, and then pushing it off to

registries like DockerHub or something.

你应该在这里做什么？
如果这是将图像和应用程序放入 Kubernetes 集群的关键部分，
我们有什么选择？
对于构建，你通常可能会开始，
如果你只是一个人在你的机器上本地构建东西，
然后把它推到注册中心，
比如 DockerHub 之类的。
* critical part 主要机件；要害部分

But, eventually you want to get to being automated.

但是，最终您想要实现自动化。

Really, most people today will

push up their software code to something like GitHub, or

Bitbucket, or GitLab.

确实，今天大多数人会将他们的软件代码推送到 GitHub，Bitbucket 或 GitLab 之类的地方。

They'll store their code somewhere, and then that's

connected to a continuous integration system.

That's CI for short, or sometimes called CICD.

That system, when it sees code changes on certain

repos, will look for the Dockerfile and

then build the image as a part of the CI workflow.

It builds that image and if everything goes well, it will

push that up to your preferred registry.

Then Kubernetes, in some fashion, either through

manual commands that we'll talk about or automated

stuff that maybe we'll get to later, like GitOps will

automatically deploy your changes to a Kubernetes server.

None of these things have to be automated to start with.

But, eventually you want that building of images,

testing of images, and deploying of images to be as

automated as your team is capable of making it.

Because that's going to be a lot of work if

you're doing it manually, which you hopefully won't be

doing. But, what about registries themselves?

Well, Kubernetes works with the same standards and

registries that the whole industry works with.

So, almost everything is going to work.

In fact, if it's called an image registry, it will work

with Kubernetes, because what's really happening down there

at the bottom is it's Docker, or your container runtime,

that's pulling those images.

That's one of the jobs of the container runtime. If you

look out there, there's lots of software as a service

products, like listed here, every cloud provider has

them. In fact, recently DigitalOcean even

announced they have their own container registry. All the

major cloud vendors have their own.

If you're a company that needs a paid version

for extra features and security, and all the benefits that products

with support come with, then there is a lot of them out

there. Here's listed a few.

Of course, if you want to build and run it yourself, you

can always do that. I'm not listing Docker distribution.

That's the original registry.

You can literally type docker run registry and that will

pull down Docker's distribution.

That's the sort of original registry that Docker came up

with.

I don't recommend you use that, even though you'll see lots

of examples on how to set that up, because it's the least

amount of features. There's so much better options out

there, including things like GitLab, and Harbor, and

Kraken. These are all open source tools.

Portus is one that actually runs on top of Docker's

distribution and gives you a GUI and other features.

You've got Quay open source now, as well as OpenShift

has a built in one for itself.

There's lots of options, and they all do, of

course, the same thing. But, how do you pick one?

Seriously, it's a tough choice.

So, here's a couple of tips.

Look at its build system.

See if it has a way to automate the building of images

for you like DockerHub does.

Look

at its multi-user features to make sure that it will handle the growth of your team

or it will integrate with existing authentication systems

you already use. Then lastly, really,

an image registry is largely just a

storage system. It's a huge HTTP-based storage

system that sends things through HTTP, but it stores

them on hard drives. There's a lot of work there.

There's garbage collection of old images and image layers.

There's caching of different registries so

that you can have downstream registries and master registries.

There's even replication between registries so

that you can have a global system of registries if you want to run your own.

These are the three, main areas that I recommend you look

at when you're comparing these. Of course, you

may already have a vendor that you work with today that already

makes one. You might want to check their's out first.
