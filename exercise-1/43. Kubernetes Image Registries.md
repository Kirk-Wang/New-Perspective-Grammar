Before we get to running our app in Kubernetes,

let's take a quick moment about registries.

Registries in Kubernetes

are not something built in. Spoiler.

There's no registry in Kubernetes, by default.

In fact, it's not designed to be a

building engine either.

If you remember from Docker, Docker was all about build,

ship, run, right.

If you have Docker locally on your machine, you can do all

of those things. You can push and pull images. You can

build images. You can rename images by tagging

them a different name. All that stuff.

But, with Kubernetes, it's not doing that out-of-the-box.

Technically, if you have Kubernetes running on top of

Docker, you can still run Docker commands on those servers.

But, if you're using a different one like Containerd, or

CRI-O as your runtime, those don't

necessarily have building features in them.

Docker is the most feature rich runtime, but

it's also doing more than what Kubernetes is meant to do.

The point here is that we are needing to pull

images into our cluster.

Can't build them there.

We need to pull them from a registry. A registry is

the way you want to get stuff into Kubernetes.

Just in case you need a refresher on how registries

work on the backend, when you do a docker run, which is

also what Kubernetes is doing when it's drilling

down into the kubelet and then down into the container

runtime, it's essentially doing a docker run with a

bunch of fancy stuff on it. But, it's doing that, and then

it's saying, OK, you've given me the Alpine image.

You said Alpine. Let me go look that up.

Well, I'm going to expand that because the Alpine is

an official image, which in registry terms means

it's a library image, or a root image, where

it'll expand it to the term library.

Then it will expand that out because Docker is the default

registry on the Internet.

So, it'll expand that out to

index.docker.io/library/alpine.

Then, it has to figure out the tag, so

it will put :latest on there if

you haven't given it a tag already. Spoiler. You should

always give production images their own tag.

You have here at the example in

the bottom where maybe on the first line we're doing a

docker pull on a GCR.

That's Google's registry.

We can do that somewhere there.

We can also build with Docker and call it something else on

your own custom registry and then push it up to your

in-house registry that you could technically run on

Kubernetes. That's fine. But, Kubernetes, itself, isn't

the registry. It's not a built-in feature, and

it's also not the image builder.

What should you do here? If this

is such a critical part of getting images and applications

into your Kubernetes clusters, what choices do

we have here? Well, with building, you typically

would maybe start out, if you're just one person building

stuff locally on your machine, and then pushing it off to

registries like DockerHub or something.

But, eventually you want to get to being automated.

Really, most people today will

push up their software code to something like GitHub, or

Bitbucket, or GitLab.

They'll store their code somewhere, and then that's

connected to a continuous integration system.

That's CI for short, or sometimes called CICD.

That system, when it sees code changes on certain

repos, will look for the Dockerfile and

then build the image as a part of the CI workflow.

It builds that image and if everything goes well, it will

push that up to your preferred registry.

Then Kubernetes, in some fashion, either through

manual commands that we'll talk about or automated

stuff that maybe we'll get to later, like GitOps will

automatically deploy your changes to a Kubernetes server.

None of these things have to be automated to start with.

But, eventually you want that building of images,

testing of images, and deploying of images to be as

automated as your team is capable of making it.

Because that's going to be a lot of work if

you're doing it manually, which you hopefully won't be

doing. But, what about registries themselves?

Well, Kubernetes works with the same standards and

registries that the whole industry works with.

So, almost everything is going to work.

In fact, if it's called an image registry, it will work

with Kubernetes, because what's really happening down there

at the bottom is it's Docker, or your container runtime,

that's pulling those images.

That's one of the jobs of the container runtime. If you

look out there, there's lots of software as a service

products, like listed here, every cloud provider has

them. In fact, recently DigitalOcean even

announced they have their own container registry. All the

major cloud vendors have their own.

If you're a company that needs a paid version

for extra features and security, and all the benefits that products

with support come with, then there is a lot of them out

there. Here's listed a few.

Of course, if you want to build and run it yourself, you

can always do that. I'm not listing Docker distribution.

That's the original registry.

You can literally type docker run registry and that will

pull down Docker's distribution.

That's the sort of original registry that Docker came up

with.

I don't recommend you use that, even though you'll see lots

of examples on how to set that up, because it's the least

amount of features. There's so much better options out

there, including things like GitLab, and Harbor, and

Kraken. These are all open source tools.

Portus is one that actually runs on top of Docker's

distribution and gives you a GUI and other features.

You've got Quay open source now, as well as OpenShift

has a built in one for itself.

There's lots of options, and they all do, of

course, the same thing. But, how do you pick one?

Seriously, it's a tough choice.

So, here's a couple of tips.

Look at its build system.

See if it has a way to automate the building of images

for you like DockerHub does.

Look

at its multi-user features to make sure that it will handle the growth of your team

or it will integrate with existing authentication systems

you already use. Then lastly, really,

an image registry is largely just a

storage system. It's a huge HTTP-based storage

system that sends things through HTTP, but it stores

them on hard drives. There's a lot of work there.

There's garbage collection of old images and image layers.

There's caching of different registries so

that you can have downstream registries and master registries.

There's even replication between registries so

that you can have a global system of registries if you want to run your own.

These are the three, main areas that I recommend you look

at when you're comparing these. Of course, you

may already have a vendor that you work with today that already

makes one. You might want to check their's out first.
