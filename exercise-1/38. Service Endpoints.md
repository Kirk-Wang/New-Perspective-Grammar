When services point to pods, they're

one of the things that services can point to.

当服务指向 pods 时，它们是服务可以指向的对象之一。

There's multiple types of services, and we'll get to those

throughout this course. We know of the things that it's

talking to as endpoints.

服务有多种类型，我们将在本课程中介绍这些服务。
我们知道它作为端点正在谈论的事情。

In this case, the list of pods is the same

as the list of endpoints.

在本例中，pod 列表与端点列表相同。

We need to understand what an endpoint is.

我们需要了解端点是什么。

We can see a list of those endpoints when we describe the

service. Let's do that now.

在描述服务时，我们可以看到这些端点的列表。我们现在就开始吧。

kubectl describe. Remember, we had describe from earlier.

It's the human friendly output for

a resource. kubectl describe

service httpenv.

kubectl describe。记住，我们之前已经描述过了。它是对人类友好的资源输出。
kubectl describe service httpenv。

Amongst all the other information here that's nice and easy

for us to read is a list of endpoints.

在这里所有其他的信息中，我们很容易阅读的是一个端点列表。
* Amongst同 among; 在…之内; 处在…中

That list of endpoints is a little

big, so we don't get to see them all.

这个端点列表有点大，所以我们无法看到所有端点。

You see there seven or more.

你看有七个或更多。

So yeah. We've got that, and we need

to use a different command to be able to see all of them.

所以是的。我们已经知道了，我们需要使用不同的命令才能看到所有这些。

We need to use a different command to see a list

of all those endpoint IP addresses.

我们需要使用一个不同的命令来查看所有这些端点IP地址的列表。

We could use kubectl get endpoints,

but that will do the same thing.

我们可以使用 kubectl get endpoints，但它的作用是一样的。

That will give us a list that is abbreviated because

there's just too many.

这将为我们提供一个缩写列表，因为列表太多了。

Here's where we need to change the output.

这是我们需要更改输出的地方。

So, we change to a -0 with yaml, and

then it gives us a nice, big list with some details.

所以，我们把它变成 -0 yaml，然后它会给我们一个漂亮的，有一些细节的大列表。

We're filtering it to the endpoints

just for httpenv here because we have other

endpoints. Remember that clusterIP for the Kubernetes API

itself? We don't want to see that one here, so we would

need to filter it to just httpenv.

我们过滤它到端点只是为了 httpenv 因为我们有其他端点。
还记得 Kubernetes API 本身的 clusterIP 吗?
我们不想在这里看到那个，所以我们需要把它过滤成 httpenv。

The other thing here is that we could also compare that

to the list of get pods with -l.

这里的另一件事是，我们还可以将其与带有 -l 的 get pod 列表进行比较。

We could also compare that list of endpoints to

a list of pods filtered by the app name

httpenv in that last command. The list will be the same.

我们还可以将这个端点列表与
最后一个命令中应用程序名称
httpenv 过滤的 pod 列表进行比较。
名单是一样的。

These three commands are extra credit if you want to run

through them yourself. In case you haven't noticed here,

there is no such thing as endpoint.

这三个命令是额外的功劳，如果你想通过他们自己。如果你还没有注意到，这里没有端点。

This is always plural.

这总是复数的。

It's one of the few exceptions, but it is an exception to

the rule of that you can throw in singular or plurals with

these resource names.

这是少数几个例外之一，
但它是一个例外，
您可以在这些资源名称中加入单数或复数。

You always have to do endpoints.

你总是要做端点。

I'm not really convinced there's a good reason, but here's

some information on why it is the way it is.

我不认为这是一个很好的理由，但这里有一些关于为什么它是这样的信息。

As a teaser for later, we're going to get into other

types of services. We're going to be using lots of them

throughout this course. There are definitely more than just

clusterIP. Obviously, you're going to need multiple

options for how to get your services available outside

your cluster so your users can actually use them.

作为以后的预告片，
我们将涉及其他类型的服务。
在本课程中，我们将大量使用它们。
肯定不仅限于 clusterIP。
显然，您将需要多个选项来确定如何在群集之外获得服务，
以便用户可以实际使用它们。

We're going to have a lot of different ways to do that.

Load balancer, we talked about as external.

NodePort is a very popular one.

Then we have other ones like External IP, which allows

you to actually set a physical IP on the node

itself. We can also use Ingress, which is an interesting,

newer option for giving us a reverse proxy

built into Kubernetes that allows us to have HTTP traffic

controlled and routed around our environment.

For now we're done with httpenv.

So, let's clean up those resources before we go to the next

lecture.
