When services point to pods, they're

one of the things that services can point to.

当服务指向 pods 时，它们是服务可以指向的对象之一。

There's multiple types of services, and we'll get to those

throughout this course. We know of the things that it's

talking to as endpoints.

服务有多种类型，我们将在本课程中介绍这些服务。
我们知道它作为端点正在谈论的事情。

In this case, the list of pods is the same

as the list of endpoints.

在本例中，pod 列表与端点列表相同。

We need to understand what an endpoint is.

我们需要了解端点是什么。

We can see a list of those endpoints when we describe the

service. Let's do that now.

在描述服务时，我们可以看到这些端点的列表。我们现在就开始吧。

kubectl describe. Remember, we had describe from earlier.

It's the human friendly output for

a resource. kubectl describe

service httpenv.

kubectl describe。记住，我们之前已经描述过了。它是对人类友好的资源输出。
kubectl describe service httpenv。

Amongst all the other information here that's nice and easy

for us to read is a list of endpoints.

在这里所有其他的信息中，我们很容易阅读的是一个端点列表。
* Amongst同 among; 在…之内; 处在…中

That list of endpoints is a little

big, so we don't get to see them all.

这个端点列表有点大，所以我们无法看到所有端点。

You see there seven or more.

你看有七个或更多。

So yeah. We've got that, and we need

to use a different command to be able to see all of them.

We need to use a different command to see a list

of all those endpoint IP addresses.

We could use kubectl get endpoints,

but that will do the same thing.

That will give us a list that is abbreviated because

there's just too many.

Here's where we need to change the output.

So, we change to a -0 with yaml, and

then it gives us a nice, big list with some details.

We're filtering it to the endpoints

just for httpenv here because we have other

endpoints. Remember that clusterIP for the Kubernetes API

itself? We don't want to see that one here, so we would

need to filter it to just httpenv.

The other thing here is that we could also compare that

to the list of get pods with -l.

We could also compare that list of endpoints to

a list of pods filtered by the app name

httpenv in that last command. The list will be the same.

These three commands are extra credit if you want to run

through them yourself. In case you haven't noticed here,

there is no such thing as endpoint.

This is always plural.

It's one of the few exceptions, but it is an exception to

the rule of that you can throw in singular or plurals with

these resource names.

You always have to do endpoints.

I'm not really convinced there's a good reason, but here's

some information on why it is the way it is.

As a teaser for later, we're going to get into other

types of services. We're going to be using lots of them

throughout this course. There are definitely more than just

clusterIP. Obviously, you're going to need multiple

options for how to get your services available outside

your cluster so your users can actually use them.

We're going to have a lot of different ways to do that.

Load balancer, we talked about as external.

NodePort is a very popular one.

Then we have other ones like External IP, which allows

you to actually set a physical IP on the node

itself. We can also use Ingress, which is an interesting,

newer option for giving us a reverse proxy

built into Kubernetes that allows us to have HTTP traffic

controlled and routed around our environment.

For now we're done with httpenv.

So, let's clean up those resources before we go to the next

lecture.
