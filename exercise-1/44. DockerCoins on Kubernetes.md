Now that we've got the registry details

out of the way, we're going to run these services on

Kubernetes. You guessed it, we're going to

have to use deployments. Which is what I talked about

earlier, is the most common way to run standard

applications on Kubernetes.

We're going to create five, different deployments.

Then we're going to need to expose some of those with

a cluster IP because they're going to be talking to each

other. You'll notice that the worker does not need to be

exposed because it's outbound only.

There's no reason for us to reach in or connect

to the worker itself. Remember the diagram?

It's doing all outbound traffic, so

it doesn't need to be exposed because there's nothing to expose.

For your convenience, I have built all the images,

and they're stored up in DockerHub.

We have multiple versions so that we can play around with

them later. But, these are the images that we're going to

start with on these custom applications.

You don't have to use DockerHub. There's nothing special

about it, necessarily, when it comes to Kubernetes.

But, it is kind of still the default place

to put things. So, we have those up there.

Go check them out on DockerHub under the DockerCoins

user.
