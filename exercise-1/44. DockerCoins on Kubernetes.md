Now that we've got the registry details

out of the way, we're going to run these services on

现在，我们已经掌握了注册表的详细信息，我们将在 Kubernetes 上运行这些服务。

Kubernetes. You guessed it, we're going to

have to use deployments. Which is what I talked about

earlier, is the most common way to run standard

applications on Kubernetes.

你猜对了，我们将不得不使用部署。这就是我前面谈到的，
是在 Kubernetes 上运行标准应用程序的最常见方式。

We're going to create five, different deployments.

我们将创建五个不同的部署。

Then we're going to need to expose some of those with

a cluster IP because they're going to be talking to each

other. You'll notice that the worker does not need to be

exposed because it's outbound only.

然后，我们将需要公开其中一些具有 cluster IP 的服务，
因为它们将彼此通信。
您会注意到，不需要公开该 worker ，
因为它只是 outbound 的。

There's no reason for us to reach in or connect

to the worker itself. Remember the diagram?

我们没有理由去接触或连接 worker 本身。还记得这个图吗?

It's doing all outbound traffic, so

it doesn't need to be exposed because there's nothing to expose.

它正在处理所有的出站流量，所以不需要暴露它，因为没有东西需要暴露。

For your convenience, I have built all the images,

and they're stored up in DockerHub.

为了你的方便，我已经建立了所有的镜像，它们存储在 DockerHub 中。

We have multiple versions so that we can play around with

them later. But, these are the images that we're going to

start with on these custom applications.

You don't have to use DockerHub. There's nothing special

about it, necessarily, when it comes to Kubernetes.

But, it is kind of still the default place

to put things. So, we have those up there.

Go check them out on DockerHub under the DockerCoins

user.
