This is pretty early on in the course, so this is a little

bit a bonus of what you're going to see later when we talk

more about YAML and digging into the

objects and resource types.

这在课程的早期，所以这是一个小小的奖励，
当我们讨论更多关于 YAML 和深入研究对象和资源类型时，
您将看到更多内容。
* bonus n.奖金;红利;意外收获

You'll see up at the top here you can type a

kubectl api-resources command.

您将在顶部看到，您可以键入 kubectl api-resources 命令。

Now that api-resources command will list you

all the resources in your cluster.

现在 api-resources 命令将列出集群中的所有资源。

We'll talk about that later. Let's just take a look at what

you got. Zoom out just a little bit so that

it's formatted to one line.

我们稍后再谈。让我们看看你有什么。缩小一点，使其格式化为一行。
* take a look at 看一看; 览
* just a little 一二；略

You'll see that I have a lot of resources.
* 你会发现我有很多资源。

What's interesting is that your resources will be different

than mine. These are objects that the API is

presenting as different types of things

I can mess with.

有趣的是你的资源和我的不同。
这些是API呈现的对象，它们是我可以处理的不同类型的对象。
* be different than 与…不同
* presenting v.把…交给;颁发;授予;提出;提交;(以某种方式)展现，显示，表现
present的现在分词
* mess with 干涉;卷入;与…有牵连

You're not going to want to mess with all of them.

你不需要与他们都有牵连。

Like I said in the past, there's a lot here

that you'll never need to mess with in most use cases.

就像我以前说过的，在大多数用例中，有很多东西是永远都不需要干涉的。

Often different deployment types will just manage

that for you, right. The distributions that you buy, or

use, from different companies may work with

different parts of these resources without your even

knowing it. You can see some interesting information.

通常不同的部署类型会为您管理这些。
您从不同的公司购买或使用的发行版
可能在您不知情的情况下使用这些资源的不同部分。
你可以看到一些有趣的信息。
* without prep. 没有；不和……在一起；不带；在……外部

Remember the abbreviations we talked about for the

different resource types?

还记得我们讨论过的不同资源类型的缩写吗?

Those can be found here.

这些可以在这里找到。

You'll recognize a few in here that we've already talked

about, including the pod here near the top.

你们会认出一些我们已经讲过的，包括靠近顶部的 pod 。

You'll see the name is pods, but the kind is pod.

你会看到它的名字叫 pods，但它的种类是 pod 。

Remember the kind. We'll talk about that later.

记住这个。我们稍后再谈。

We'll talk about namespaces later.

稍后我们将讨论名称空间。

But for now, I just want you to know that this

api-resources command exists.

但是现在，我只想让您知道这个 api-resources 命令是存在的。

This changes based on the add-ons

and plugins that you have in your Kubernetes cluster.

这是根据您的 Kubernetes 集群中的附加组件和插件进行更改的。

Going back to the slide for a second, let's talk about the

explain command. The explain command is introspection

documentation.

回到幻灯片上，让我们讨论一下 explain 命令。explain 命令是自省文档。

What do I mean by that? Well, we'll talk about the

difference between those fancy words in a minute.

这是什么意思呢?我们马上就会讨论这些华丽的词之间的区别。

Really what it's doing here is it's looking

at that API resources.

它在这里做的是查看 API 资源。

It's pulling out its own information of what

it knows about that resource to help give you some more

information, including some human type help

stuff. It's pretty nice.

它会提取出它所知道的
关于这个资源的信息
来帮助你获得更多的信息，
包括一些人性化类型的帮助。
很好。

Let's just pick one.

我们选一个。

Let's do kubectl explain

node.

让我们使用 kubectl explain node

We get back what is the node object.

我们得到的是 node 对象。

It gives you some basic information.

它会给你一些基本的信息。

It talks about kind inversion. Remember that kind

we just talked about.

它谈到了 kind 的倒置。记得我们刚才说的 kind。
* inversion n. 倒置；反向；倒转

It gives you some basic information.

它会给你一些基本的信息。

It shows you the next level fields

that you can change, or work with, in that particular

resource.

它向您显示可以在该特定资源中更改或使用的下一个级别的字段。
* particular adj. 特别的；详细的；独有的；挑剔的

We can dig into those.

我们可以深入研究一下。

One of those is spec. That's one of the fields

we can then just hit the up arrow and type node.spec.

其中一个是 spec。
这是我们可以点击向上箭头并键入 node.spec 的字段之一。

That allows us to drill into this object

and see what other objects are below it.

这使我们能够深入研究这个对象并查看它下面的其他对象。
* drill into 用（机器、工具等）在（某物）上钻孔;反复地将…教授（灌输）给（某人）
* below prep. 在……下面；（位置或层面）低于；在……以下，低于

We get more information about that one.

我们得到更多关于那个的信息。

It gives us a definition.

它给了我们一个定义。

It talks about what type of resource it is.

它讨论的是什么类型的资源。

Then fields underneath that.

然后在下面的字段。
* underneath prep. 在……底下；在书页下面；在……表象下；（部分或全部）在衣服下面；（掩盖）在（另一物体）下面；（人）本质上

We could go on and on.

我们可以继续下去。

We could keep drilling down all the way through the API

this way. This is one way to explore it, at the command

line. If we wanted to just show a full list

of all of the fields that we can control with

that particular resource type, we can use the --recursive

argument on that command.

我们可以通过这种方式一直深入到 API。
这是在命令行中探索它的一种方法。
如果我们只想显示一个可以用特定资源类型控制的所有字段的完整列表，
那么可以对该命令使用 --recursive 参数。
* drill down 向地下钻；深度探讨
* all the way 一路上；自始至终
* recursive adj. [数] 递归的；循环的

We can type kubectl explain

node --recursive.

我们可以输入 kubectl explain node --recursive

We'll get back, not

a small list by any means, but this is pretty standard for

resources in Kubernetes.

我们将返回，
无论如何都不是一个小列表，
但这对于 Kubernetes 中的资源来说是非常标准的。
* by any means 尽一切办法

Lots of things for us to mess with.

我们有很多事情要处理。

You probably won't use most of these in any

project you're working on.

你可能不会在你正在进行的任何项目中使用其中的大部分。

But, that's the point. There's lots of things you could do.

但是，这就是重点。你可以做很多事情。

They all have defaults that you can look at in the

documentation, and you probably

will leave out a lot of them at default.

它们都有默认值，你可以在文档中看到，你可能会遗漏很多默认值。
* leave out 排除; 不包括

So that's fine. Let's talk about this introspection versus

the documentation for a minute.

所以没关系。让我们讨论一下这个内省与文档的对比。
* versus prep. 对，对抗；与……相对，与……相比

There is API documentation.

有API文档。

In fact, in the slides, I can click on this API

documentation link, and it will take me over to the

Kubernetes documentation site.

实际上，在幻灯片中，我可以点击这个 API 文档链接，
它会把我带到 Kubernetes 文档站点。

I can click on the version I'm using and

I jump into the API docs.

我可以点击我正在使用的版本，然后跳转到API文档。
* jump into 跳入; 急于做某事；急速行动

I can scroll on the left to the resource type that

I care about.

We were just looking at nodes.

Then on the right, it'll give me all the information that

I would get at the command line and more.

It actually gives me examples here. A little bit more

detail. It's easier to look at.

The nice thing is you have both.

Now the big difference is that the generic

documentation on the website is just going to give you the

official resource types and the API

information for a standard Kubernetes cluster.

We talked about that different distributions, and different

plugins, will extend and change that resource list.

It'll give you new features and new stuff to look at.

So, you're going to need to know both of these methods

because that introspection of using the command line

uses the API of your cluster to find out

about those resources. So, you're going to need to use that

as well for those different resource types that maybe

are in your list but aren't in the official documentation.

Just as a refresher like we talked about, these different

resource names. They sometimes are singular,

sometimes are plural.

They sometimes have short names that you can use as well.

We saw that in the api-resources list.

Here are some examples.

You can use deployment or deployments or deploy.

Some don't have a short name.

Some, especially ones like endpoints, are only

plural. So, like I said, it can be a little

bit inconsistent here.

At least it sometimes feels like that, but you'll get used

to it, I think eventually.

The nice thing is, is that you'll know right away when it

doesn't work. It'll just give you an error saying, I don't

know what that resource is. You made it up.

Then you'll just realize, oh, I meant to put endpoints,

not endpoint. So, no big deal.
