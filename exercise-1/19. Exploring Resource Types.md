This is pretty early on in the course, so this is a little

bit a bonus of what you're going to see later when we talk

more about YAML and digging into the

objects and resource types.

这在课程的早期，所以这是一个小小的奖励，
当我们讨论更多关于 YAML 和深入研究对象和资源类型时，
您将看到更多内容。

You'll see up at the top here you can type a

kubectl api-resources command.

您将在顶部看到，您可以键入 kubectl api-resources 命令。

Now that api-resources command will list you

all the resources in your cluster.

现在 api-resources 命令将列出集群中的所有资源。

We'll talk about that later. Let's just take a look at what

you got. Zoom out just a little bit so that

it's formatted to one line.

我们稍后再谈。让我们看看你有什么。缩小一点，使其格式化为一行。
* take a look at 看一看; 览
* just a little 一二；略

You'll see that I have a lot of resources.
* 你会发现我有很多资源。

What's interesting is that your resources will be different

than mine. These are objects that the API is

presenting as different types of things

I can mess with.

有趣的是你的资源和我的不同。
这些是API呈现的对象，它们是我可以处理的不同类型的对象。
* be different than 与…不同
* presenting v.把…交给;颁发;授予;提出;提交;(以某种方式)展现，显示，表现
present的现在分词
* mess with 干涉;卷入;与…有牵连

You're not going to want to mess with all of them.

你不需要与他们都有牵连。

Like I said in the past, there's a lot here

that you'll never need to mess with in most use cases.

就像我以前说过的，在大多数用例中，有很多东西是永远都不需要干涉的。

Often different deployment types will just manage

that for you, right. The distributions that you buy, or

use, from different companies may work with

different parts of these resources without your even

knowing it. You can see some interesting information.

通常不同的部署类型会为您管理这些。
您从不同的公司购买或使用的发行版
可能在您不知情的情况下使用这些资源的不同部分。
你可以看到一些有趣的信息。

Remember the abbreviations we talked about for the

different resource types?

Those can be found here.

You'll recognize a few in here that we've already talked

about, including the pod here near the top.

You'll see the name is pods, but the kind is pod.

Remember the kind. We'll talk about that later.

We'll talk about namespaces later.

But for now, I just want you to know that this

api-resources command exists.

This changes based on the add-ons

and plugins that you have in your Kubernetes cluster.

Going back to the slide for a second, let's talk about the

explain command. The explain command is introspection

documentation.

What do I mean by that? Well, we'll talk about the

difference between those fancy words in a minute.

Really what it's doing here is it's looking

at that API resources.

It's pulling out its own information of what

it knows about that resource to help give you some more

information, including some human type help

stuff. It's pretty nice.

Let's just pick one.

Let's do kubectl explain

node.

We get back what is the node object.

It gives you some basic information.

It talks about kind inversion. Remember that kind

we just talked about.

It gives you some basic information.

It shows you the next level fields

that you can change, or work with, in that particular

resource.

We can dig into those.

One of those is spec. That's one of the fields

we can then just hit the up arrow and type node.spec.

That allows us to drill into this object

and see what other objects are below it.

We get more information about that one.

It gives us a definition.

It talks about what type of resource it is.

Then fields underneath that.

We could go on and on.

We could keep drilling down all the way through the API

this way. This is one way to explore it, at the command

line. If we wanted to just show a full list

of all of the fields that we can control with

that particular resource type, we can use the --recursive

argument on that command.

We can type kubectl explain

node --recursive.

We'll get back, not

a small list by any means, but this is pretty standard for

resources in Kubernetes.

Lots of things for us to mess with.

You probably won't use most of these in any

project you're working on.

But, that's the point. There's lots of things you could do.

They all have defaults that you can look at in the

documentation, and you probably

will leave out a lot of them at default.

So that's fine. Let's talk about this introspection versus

the documentation for a minute.

There is API documentation.

In fact, in the slides, I can click on this API

documentation link, and it will take me over to the

Kubernetes documentation site.

I can click on the version I'm using and

I jump into the API docs.

I can scroll on the left to the resource type that

I care about.

We were just looking at nodes.

Then on the right, it'll give me all the information that

I would get at the command line and more.

It actually gives me examples here. A little bit more

detail. It's easier to look at.

The nice thing is you have both.

Now the big difference is that the generic

documentation on the website is just going to give you the

official resource types and the API

information for a standard Kubernetes cluster.

We talked about that different distributions, and different

plugins, will extend and change that resource list.

It'll give you new features and new stuff to look at.

So, you're going to need to know both of these methods

because that introspection of using the command line

uses the API of your cluster to find out

about those resources. So, you're going to need to use that

as well for those different resource types that maybe

are in your list but aren't in the official documentation.

Just as a refresher like we talked about, these different

resource names. They sometimes are singular,

sometimes are plural.

They sometimes have short names that you can use as well.

We saw that in the api-resources list.

Here are some examples.

You can use deployment or deployments or deploy.

Some don't have a short name.

Some, especially ones like endpoints, are only

plural. So, like I said, it can be a little

bit inconsistent here.

At least it sometimes feels like that, but you'll get used

to it, I think eventually.

The nice thing is, is that you'll know right away when it

doesn't work. It'll just give you an error saying, I don't

know what that resource is. You made it up.

Then you'll just realize, oh, I meant to put endpoints,

not endpoint. So, no big deal.
