All right. Let's create a deployment with something that we

can use to expose.

Now, we can't just use ping because that's not listening

on any ports, and it's not going to return anything if we

try to cURL it. Let's launch a simple little

utility called httpenv.

Created by my friend Jerome.

This is really just a 20 or 30 line Go program

that starts a web server listening on port

8888. Then, all it will do when you cURL

it is return the environment variables that

Kubernetes gave the application when it launched it.

One of the benefits here is that when it returns that data,

it'll return the hostname, which is also the container

name in the pod, which is nice because it

allows us to see different endpoints and where we're

actually connecting to this thing. So, it's pretty neat for

a simple little utility in a distributed system like this.

Here, we could just do a kubectl run like we're used to,

but I want to get you used to these other commands like

create. I really like create.

It allows me to be very specific about what

I'm creating instead of the run, which is evolving

and changing over time.

Who knows what it will be doing a year or two from now.

Let's stick with the create command instead.

I'm going to have to windows open so we can watch this

happen. In one window, I'm going to use a kubectl get

pods with a -w.

It's a new option you haven't seen yet, but that allows us

to watch things as they're created.

It's a pretty neat option on the get command.

It'll sit here and wait for stuff to happen.

Then you'll see it, almost like watching logs,

it'll just put the different lines of the different states

that things are in as they happen.

Over here on the right, I'm going to do a kubectl create

deployment.

We're going to call this httpenv.

We're going to use my image bretfisher/httpenv.

When we do that, it's going to create one pod.

It's a little confusing on the left if you're not used to

that, is it looks like it's creating lots of things.

This is not the same as other options

you've seen for watching real-time commands happen.

This one is just giving us any time there's

a state change, or any information that changes about a

pod, it just lists another line.

It's not going to squash them all together and to show just

one line updating itself.

Think of it like a log.

Now we know the latest state is it's

running, OK.

If we did control c here, and

then we did get pods without the -w,

we would see that, yep, we just have this one pod here for

httpenv. If we do get all, of course we're going

to see the deployment and the ReplicaSet that

match this pod.

We've seen that. Nothing new.

All right. Now, let's go back on the left.

We're going to do the -w again on the pods command

so that we can watch it. Then we're going to scale this up,

scale deployment httpenv. We're giving

it the deployment name --replicas 10.

You'll see all sorts of stuff happen on the left.

Now that that's happened, I'm going to use an expose

command to create this service for

those pods. kubectl expose

deployment httpenv.

I'm going to tell it the port that it's running on

8888.

That's which port my pods are listening

on. What's interesting here is that we are telling

it to expose a deployment, but it's not really routing

traffic to a deployment.

A deployment is just a concept.

It's an abstraction.

It's the pods that need to receive traffic.

So, really what's happening is in IP tables, on

our nodes, we're creating rules via the kube-proxy

agent. It's going to direct traffic to

the pods in a round robin fashion, by default,

on Port 8888.

It's using the deployment as a selector for deciding

which pods need to be inside this service.

That's why we're using the deployment here.

All right. This doesn't change our pods.

You'll notice on the left that the pods don't have to

update because we're really creating just an additional

resource type that is now going to be able

to route traffic. If we do a kubectl get service,

you'll see that we now have two.

The original one, which is the cluster IP of

the cluster itself for Kubernetes.

Then this new one for our deployment,

httpenv. You'll notice that the service is also called

httpenv. Here's a tip about naming.

Inside of any namespace, and remember, we're in the default

namespace right now.

In a namespace, you can have the same name

for different resource types, but you can't have

a name collision of the combination

of the resource type and the name of the resource.

So, I couldn't have two services called httpenv,

but I can have a deployment called that and a service

called that. That makes sense.

All right.
