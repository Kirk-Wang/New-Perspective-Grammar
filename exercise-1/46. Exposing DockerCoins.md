Now we need to deal with the webui.

The webui is special because we need it to be accessible

outside the cluster.

Which means we have less options for the service type.

We've talked about NodePort, so let's just use that one

for now. That works here.

If you're on Docker Desktop, that'll work.

On just about any scenario, it'll work.

It should be using localhost in most of

those situations. If you're using something like Minikube,

which won't support the localhost name, then you'll have

to just get the IP address of your Kubernetes

machine. All right.

Go into the command line and we're going to type the

kubectl command as before.

expose deploy webui,

but this time, we're going to specify the type.

- - type=NodePort

--port is 80, just

like the other ones.

Remember, this is going to give us a random port in the

30,000/32,000 range, something like that.

Let's do a kubectl get services.

You can type in svc, service, services, it doesn't really

matter. We'll see the list

here.

The one we care about is the webui node port.

Your port that you're going to get is possibly different

than mine. I'm on

30249 there. That's the port that I need to look at on my

local machine, because I'm on Docker Desktop,

to get to that port.

localhost 3 0 2 4 9.

What I should see is what we saw with Docker Compose,

which is about four hashes a second, cycling

between four and nothing. It's just going to go back and

forth. So, if you've got that, good job.

You've now got a working DockerCoin miner on Kubernetes.

Round of applause. Round of applause.

From here, our job is about

making this go higher.

Why isn't it running 4000 a

second, right. The first thing is maybe

we've got something where we need to scale it up.

Maybe we need to just give it more containers to do more

work. Let's take a look at that.
