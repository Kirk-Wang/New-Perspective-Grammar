Now we need to deal with the webui.

现在我们需要处理 webui。

The webui is special because we need it to be accessible

outside the cluster.

webui 是特殊的，因为我们需要它可以在集群之外访问。

Which means we have less options for the service type.

这意味着我们对服务类型的选择更少。

We've talked about NodePort, so let's just use that one

for now. That works here.

我们已经讨论了 NodePort，现在我们就用这个。在这里工作。

If you're on Docker Desktop, that'll work.

如果您在 Docker Desktop 上，那将起作用。

On just about any scenario, it'll work.

在任何情况下，它都会起作用的。

It should be using localhost in most of

those situations. If you're using something like Minikube,

which won't support the localhost name, then you'll have

to just get the IP address of your Kubernetes

machine. All right.

它应该在大多数情况下使用 localhost。
如果您使用的是 Minikube 之类的东西，
它不支持本地主机名，
那么您只能获得 Kubernetes 机器的 IP 地址。
好吧。

Go into the command line and we're going to type the

kubectl command as before.

进入命令行，我们将像以前一样输入 kubectl 命令。

expose deploy webui,

but this time, we're going to specify the type.

但这次，我们要指定类型。

- - type=NodePort

--port is 80, just

like the other ones.

就像其他的一样。

Remember, this is going to give us a random port in the

30,000/32,000 range, something like that.

记住，这将为我们提供一个 30000/32000 范围内的随机端口，类似于这样。

Let's do a kubectl get services.

让我们做一个 kubectl get services

You can type in svc, service, services, it doesn't really

matter. We'll see the list

here.

你可以输入 svc，service，services，这并不重要。我们可以在这里看到列表。

The one we care about is the webui node port.

我们关心的一个是 webui 节点端口。

Your port that you're going to get is possibly different

than mine. I'm on

你的端口可能和我的不一样。我在 30249 这里。

30249 there. That's the port that I need to look at on my

local machine, because I'm on Docker Desktop,

to get to that port.

这是我需要在本地机器上查看的端口，
因为我在 Docker Desktop，才能到达该端口。

localhost 3 0 2 4 9.

What I should see is what we saw with Docker Compose,

which is about four hashes a second, cycling

between four and nothing. It's just going to go back and

forth. So, if you've got that, good job.

You've now got a working DockerCoin miner on Kubernetes.

Round of applause. Round of applause.

From here, our job is about

making this go higher.

Why isn't it running 4000 a

second, right. The first thing is maybe

we've got something where we need to scale it up.

Maybe we need to just give it more containers to do more

work. Let's take a look at that.
