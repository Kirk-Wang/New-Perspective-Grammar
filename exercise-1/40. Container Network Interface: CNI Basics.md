Out-of-the-box, Kubernetes has something called kubenet,

which you can use. If you're doing something like

Docker Desktop or minikube, you might find that some

of these tools are using kubenet, which works great on a

single node. It doesn't provide a lot of features, but it

is there. What most of us will do in our real

world setups is use something called CNI plugins.

开箱即用的，Kubernetes 有一个叫做 kubenet 的东西，你可以使用它。
如果您正在使用 Docker Desktop 或 minikube 之类的工具，
您可能会发现其中一些工具正在使用 kubenet，
它在单个节点上工作得非常好。
它没有提供很多特性，但它确实存在。
我们大多数人在现实世界中会使用 CNI 插件。

That's an abbreviation for the Container Network Interface,

which is a standard in the industry that allows

all of these third-party vendors to support Kubernetes

with their plugins.

这是容器网络接口（Container Network Interface）的缩写，
它是业界的一个标准，
允许所有这些第三方供应商使用他们的插件支持 Kubernetes。

Some of the jobs in your cluster are delegated

to these plugins, including things like getting an IP

address. That's what we call IPAM, IP Address

Management, and doing other things like creating

the network interface itself inside the pod.

您的集群中的一些作业被委托给这些插件，包括获取 IP 地址之类的事情。
这就是我们所说的 IPAM, IP 地址管理，
以及做其他事情，
比如在 pod 中创建网络接口本身。

The more you dive into the networking of Kubernetes, the

more you will see different parts of the puzzle

that are managed by different parts of the puzzle.

你越深入地研究 Kubernetes 的网络，
你就越能看到这个谜题的不同部分是由
这个谜题的不同部分管理的。

The first up here is the pod-to-pod communication,

which doesn't happen a whole lot because typically, our

pods are communicating through services.

这里的第一个是 Pod 到 Pod 的通信，
这不会发生很多，因为通常情况下，
我们的 Pod 通过服务进行通信。

So, there is an ability for you to talk to the pods

directly from the host, and vice versa.

所以，你可以直接从 host 那里和 pod 通信，反之亦然。
* and vice versa 反之亦然

But, that all tends to be managed by the CNI.

但是，这些都倾向于由 CNI 来管理。

When we talk about our pods talking to a service,

like we just did in our httpenv example,

that's typically managed by kube-proxy, or if you

decide to use kube-router, kube-router.

当我们谈论与服务进行通信的Pod时（就像我们在httpenv示例中所做的那样），
通常由 kube-proxy 来管理，
或者如果您决定使用 kube-router，
则由 kube-router 管理。 

Those parts act as the load

balancer in between your container and talking to that

service. This last one here is a biggie.

这些部分充当容器与服务之间的负载均衡器。
最后一个是一个大问题。
* biggie n.重要的人(或事物);大事;大人物

The big part about these CNI plugins is they may,

or may not, support something called network

policies.

关于这些CNI插件的主要部分是它们可能支持，
也可能不支持所谓的网络策略。

That is a key part of your CNI choice.

这是你选择 CNI 的关键部分。

When you choose your plugin, you have to decide, do I need

to protect certain pods from other

pods and their communications in this cluster?

选择插件时，您必须决定，
我是否需要保护某些 Pod 免受此集群中其他 Pod
及其通信的影响？

The bigger your clusters get, and the more unrelated

services you start to run in that cluster, the more you're

likely going to want to segment your network

infrastructure inside the same cluster.

集群越大，在集群中运行的无关服务越多，
就越可能希望在同一集群中分割网络基础设施。

That's what network policies are for.

这就是网络策略的作用。

That feature is not available in every CNI.

该功能并非在每个CNI中都可用。

So, you'll see some of the resources listed in these

lectures around networking and listing out the

CNI options.

因此，您将看到这些讲座中列出的关于网络和列出 CNI 选项的一些资源。

There's websites that have different comparisons of them

and show you which ones are default for each deployment

option for your cluster.

有一些网站对它们进行了不同的比较，并向您展示哪些是集群中每个部署选项的默认选项。

There's lots of stuff out there to read.

有很多东西可供阅读。
* out there 到战场，在那里

We're not going to go through all that just yet because

that stuff changes rapidly.

我们现在还不打算讲所有这些，因为这些东西变化很快。
* rapidly adv.迅速;高速;急速地;急促

New things come into the market.

新事物进入市场。

Old products, or open source tools, fall off the list

because they're no longer supported.

旧的产品或开源工具由于不再受支持而从列表中消失。
* fall off 脱落，掉落; 降低，减小
* no longer 不再

Some get added new features and are now supporting

network policies when they previously didn't.

一些人增加了新功能，现在支持以前没有的网络策略。

But, if you think now that you're going to need

at some point in this clusters future, the ability

to protect certain pods from other pods

by network firewall rules and the like, then

you're going to want a CNI with network policies

但是，如果您现在认为您将在这个集群的未来的某个时候
需要通过网络防火墙规则之类的能力
来保护某些 pods 免受其他 pods 的攻击，
那么您将需要一个内置网络策略的 CNI。

built in. Because if you're thinking about it right now,

changing the CNI in the middle of a cluster

deployment is a pretty unrealistic

因为如果您现在正在考虑，在集群部署过程中更改 CNI 是一件非常不现实的事情。
* in the middle of 正忙于
* unrealistic 不切实际的

thing to expect. Which means if you need to change your CNI

later, because maybe the one you have doesn't have the

features you want, you're going to need to build a new

cluster, and then you're going to need to move your stuff

这意味着如果你以后需要改变你的 CNI，
因为可能你的 CNI 没有你想要的功能，
你将需要建立一个新的集群，
然后你将需要把你的东西移过去。

over. Don't freak out at that, because one

of the core ideas here when you're making these clusters,

and we'll talk more about this throughout the course, is

that you need to design them in a way that they can be

replaced in the future.

不要为此而惊慌失措，
因为当你创建这些集群时，
这里的核心思想之一，
我们将在整个课程中对此进行更多的讨论，
就是你需要以一种可以在将来替换它们的方式来设计它们。
* freak out 大吃一惊; 极度不安; 大发雷霆; 极度困惑
* in the future 今后

You don't want to make these clusters so special and so

brittle that you simply can't replace it with a new one,

because you're going to have to make changes later.

您不希望将这些集群变得如此特殊和脆弱，
以至于无法用新的集群替换它，
因为稍后您将不得不进行更改。

You're going to have to make decisions that would

affect your entire cluster.

您将不得不做出影响整个集群的决策。

You may just decide, for safety reasons, to build a new

cluster and move your apps over.

You won't have to do that all the time, but one of the core

tenants here of DevOps is that we're not creating brittle

and fragile infrastructure that we can't replace

in a reasonable amount of time.

If you decide to get a little bit more complicated

than we've already talked about, you can do things

where certain parts of your infrastructure are doing

multiple parts of this networking component.

In other words, you can have certain connections coming in

through load balancers.

You can have other connections coming in through

kube-proxy. You can have other connections coming in

through a meta-plugin.

You can have other types of networking than just

the default CNI plugin that you choose.

You can have meta CNI plugins where you choose

multiples.

I've not seen that in the wild myself.

Most people are trying to keep their clusters as small and

as simple as possible.

It is an option once you get to that level of complexity.
