All right. Let's expand a little bit on that logs command

and see what happens when we delete a pod that we're

watching in the logs.

好吧。让我们在 logs 命令上展开一点，
看看当我们删除一个在日志中监视的 pod 时会发生什么。

Let's go back to the command line and just control c

out of whatever logs command if you were still there.

让我们回到命令行，如果您还在那里的话
只需 control c 退出任何 logs 命令。

Or, if you're at the command line and hopefully, that pod

is still running. Then, you're going to just hit the up

arrow so that you have the kubectl logs, pingpong

tail 1 follow.

或者，如果你在命令行，希望那个 pod 还在运行。
然后点击向上的箭头这样就得到了 kubectl logs，pingpong tail 1 跟随。

When you do that, really quick, copy the pod

name that you have there.

当你这样做的时候，非常快地，复制你那里的 pod 名称。

All right. It picked one of the pods, remember, and we're

going to copy that and then in a separate shell,

so in my screen, I have a shell here on the right.

好吧。它选择了一个 pod，
记住，我们要复制它，然后在一个单独的 shell 里，
所以在我的屏幕上，右边有一个 shell。

I'm going to delete that pod, which, you know,

you don't want to do in the real world, but it's good for

playing around and learning how this works.

我要删掉那个 pod，
你知道，在现实世界里你不想这么做，
但它对玩耍和学习这是如何工作的
有好处。

Remember that these layers of abstractions manage each

other. So, the deployment at top is managing and watching

the ReplicaSet to make sure that it's behaving correctly.

The ReplicaSet is watching the pods.

请记住，这些抽象层是相互管理的。
因此，顶部的部署是管理和监视 ReplicaSet，以确保它的行为正确。
ReplicaSet 正在监视这些 pods。

In this case, now we have three pods, and it's making

sure that there's always three pods running.

在这种情况下，我们有三个 pod，
它确保总是有三个 pod 在运行。

So, if a pod goes missing, it's supposed to

replace it. That's its job.

所以，如果一个 pod 不见了，就应该换掉它。那是它的工作。

Let's go delete one.

让我们删除一个。

So, back at the shell, I'm going to control c out

of that logs command, and we're going to do a kubectl get

pods. Instead of just typing that

command, I'm going to back up.

回到 shell，我要用 control c 退出 log 命令，
我们要做一个 kubectl get pods。
我不只是输入那个命令，而是备份。

On a Linux system, I'm going to type the watch command.

Not every system will have this.

在Linux系统上，我将键入 watch 命令。
不是所有的系统都会有这个。

I don't believe Windows works this way.

我不相信 Windows 是这样工作的。

Remember that sh pod container that

you can use to get all these utilities inside your

Kubernetes cluster, in case you don't have them on your

host. Remember that.

请记住，sh pod 容器
可以用于在 Kubernetes 集群中获得所有这些实用程序，
以防您的主机上没有它们。
记住这一点。

Go back and look at that lecture to get the sh pod utility

container.

回去看看那个讲座，找到 sh pod 实用容器。

Now I can type this watch and it will sit here, if I

zoom out a little bit, and it will continually,

every two seconds, run that same get pods

command so that we can see the three pods.

现在我可以输入这个 watch，
它会在这里，如果我缩小一点，
它会持续地，每两秒，
运行相同的 get pods 命令，这样我们就能看到三个 pods。

Over on the right, I'm going to do a kubectl delete,

which allows you to delete resources.

在右边，我要做一个 kubectl delete，它允许你删除资源。

I'm going to type pod/pingpong and

that number. That was the number I copied and pasted from

the list in the OS.

我要输入 pod/pingpong 和那个数字。
这是我从操作系统的列表中复制粘贴的数字。

Or, you can just copy and paste one of the three here.

或者，你可以复制粘贴这三个中的一个。

You'll notice that you'll see one that's marked terminating

and then it automatically created another one.

你会注意到你会看到一个标记为终止然后它会自动创建另一个。

In fact, in this case, I've now currently got four

running at the same time, even though one is in terminating

state. Why is that?

实际上，在本例中，我现在已经同时运行了四个，
尽管其中一个处于终止状态。这是为什么呢?

Why are we seeing another one start even

though we've got this one terminating? That

has to do with proper shutdown, which we will go over

several times in this course, because shutdown of

containers is very important.

为什么我们看到另一个开始，即使我们有一个终止?
这与适当的关闭有关，我们将在本课程中多次讨论，
因为关闭容器是非常重要的。

Shutdown is so important, in fact, that I

make entire talks at conferences where I talk

at length about proper shutdown of containers.

关闭是如此重要，事实上，我在会议上做了完整的演讲，在那里我详细地谈论了如何正确地关闭容器。

Because if you're going to live in a world where you're

replacing applications over and over again, maybe

even on a daily basis, the shutdown and healthy, proper

and hopefully quick shutdown of your

containers is critical because you're going to be replacing

them and you don't want to lose connections.

因为如果你要生活在一个世界, 
你替换应用程序一遍又一遍,
甚至每天, 关闭和健康检查, 
适当的, 希望快速关闭你的容器是至关重要的,
因为你将会取代他们, 并且你不想失去连接。

You don't want to have slow shutdowns.

In our case, we're using the ping command.

The ping command is not using a proper shutdown, which

is fine. It's just the ping command.

It's not a real world app, right.

We're not trying to run this in real world scenario, but

the ping is a good example of a bad shutdown.

What it does is it's ignoring this term signal sent to

it from the Docker runtime,

essentially because Kubernetes told Docker to shutdown the

container. Then it's waiting 30 seconds.

That's a default in Kubernetes to wait for

the container to shut down. You can always change this.

You can make it shorter. You can make it longer, depending

on your application's needs. But, once it hits that limit,

it will then do a kill on the

container itself.

If we go back to the command line while I've been talking,

you'll see that we're now down to the three

containers that our ReplicasSet expects.

So, we're now back in a healthy state.
