All right. Let's expand a little bit on that logs command

and see what happens when we delete a pod that we're

watching in the logs.

Let's go back to the command line and just control c

out of whatever logs command if you were still there.

Or, if you're at the command line and hopefully, that pod

is still running. Then, you're going to just hit the up

arrow so that you have the kubectl logs, pingpong

tail 1 follow.

When you do that, really quick, copy the pod

name that you have there.

All right. It picked one of the pods, remember, and we're

going to copy that and then in a separate shell,

so in my screen, I have a shell here on the right.

I'm going to delete that pod, which, you know,

you don't want to do in the real world, but it's good for

playing around and learning how this works.

Remember that these layers of abstractions manage each

other. So, the deployment at top is managing and watching

the ReplicaSet to make sure that it's behaving correctly.

The ReplicaSet is watching the pods.

In this case, now we have three pods, and it's making

sure that there's always three pods running.

So, if a pod goes missing, it's supposed to

replace it. That's its job.

Let's go delete one.

So, back at the shell, I'm going to control c out

of that logs command, and we're going to do a kubectl get

pods. Instead of just typing that

command, I'm going to back up.

On a Linux system, I'm going to type the watch command.

Not every system will have this.

I don't believe Windows works this way.

Remember that sh pod container that

you can use to get all these utilities inside your

Kubernetes cluster, in case you don't have them on your

host. Remember that.

Go back and look at that lecture to get the sh pod utility

container.

Now I can type this watch and it will sit here, if I

zoom out a little bit, and it will continually,

every two seconds, run that same get pods

command so that we can see the three pods.

Over on the right, I'm going to do a kubectl delete,

which allows you to delete resources.

I'm going to type pod/pingpong and

that number. That was the number I copied and pasted from

the list in the OS.

Or, you can just copy and paste one of the three here.

You'll notice that you'll see one that's marked terminating

and then it automatically created another one.

In fact, in this case, I've now currently got four

running at the same time, even though one is in terminating

state. Why is that?

Why are we seeing another one start even

though we've got this one terminating? That

has to do with proper shutdown, which we will go over

several times in this course, because shutdown of

containers is very important.

Shutdown is so important, in fact, that I

make entire talks at conferences where I talk

at length about proper shutdown of containers.

Because if you're going to live in a world where you're

replacing applications over and over again, maybe

even on a daily basis, the shutdown and healthy, proper

and hopefully quick shutdown of your

containers is critical because you're going to be replacing

them and you don't want to lose connections.

You don't want to have slow shutdowns.

In our case, we're using the ping command.

The ping command is not using a proper shutdown, which

is fine. It's just the ping command.

It's not a real world app, right.

We're not trying to run this in real world scenario, but

the ping is a good example of a bad shutdown.

What it does is it's ignoring this term signal sent to

it from the Docker runtime,

essentially because Kubernetes told Docker to shutdown the

container. Then it's waiting 30 seconds.

That's a default in Kubernetes to wait for

the container to shut down. You can always change this.

You can make it shorter. You can make it longer, depending

on your application's needs. But, once it hits that limit,

it will then do a kill on the

container itself.

If we go back to the command line while I've been talking,

you'll see that we're now down to the three

containers that our ReplicasSet expects.

So, we're now back in a healthy state.
