This course is based upon a

workshop that myself, Jérôme, and a lot of other people

have been using in the open source community for years.

It started out as Docker, then it became Docker and Swarm.

Then it became Docker and Kubernetes.

And so I've taken that, extended it to

add more information, and this

means that there are many people evolving this content,

which means you get the best of a bunch of different

brains. So thank you to that community and for all the PRs

and open source help with that because there's so much here

to learn. But even this course can't be everything

you need to learn a tool. You're going to

have to spend some time practicing. You're going to need to

research special issues per your setup, right, so

not everything is going to be in this course.

That's obvious, I guess, of any course.

I just want to say that upfront.

That's why we have the Slack community, Q&A, and all this

other stuff. This will take practice and this

course isn't designed to teach you feature-by-feature like

some courses might. That probably

isn't the best way to learn. We're going to learn by

digging in and trying to solve problems.

We're gonna deploy different applications.

We're gonna have one large project throughout this course,

but other small tools and utilities will be running.

That's going to hopefully help you learn the patterns and

the commands that you'll be using over and over.

And to get started with this, you

don't need a ton of Docker experience.

You definitely need to understand Docker, know

how to run containers, know how to build them.

But you don't have to necessarily be a Docker guru.

You do need some command line skills.

You need to know some basics around command lines and Bash

shells and similar things, but you

probably already have some of that, if you're familiar with

Docker and you've taken another course on it, like my

Docker Mastery course. We want to involve you

as much as possible, which is why when you see exercises

like this one, this

exercise is meant for you to do with me. Now, I'm going to

be doing it on the screen so you can always watch it if you

want, but you're definitely not going to get the synapses

in your brain working unless you're typing these

commands. And the nice thing is, we'll provide enough

installation options that you can even do this on an iPad

and a web browser, if you had to.

But ideally, you're following these exercises.

Notice that it'll be the parts that are dashed outlined

with the keyboard logo.

That keyboard logo means you

should be typing this along with me.
