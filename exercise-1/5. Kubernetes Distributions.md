Before we get into what Kubernetes is and how it does the

things it does, we need to understand a little bit of the

landscape. There's lots of tools and lots of products

out there. Let's just break down a few key terms of

the ecosystem of Kubernetes.

First, is the vanilla upstream.

That is the GitHub repos that store

all of the pure Kubernetes project

source code. You can deploy those with various tools.

Then there are other ways of deploying

Kubernetes as well. There's lots of options.

If you were to break down the different types of these

distributions, or install options, you might break

them into different types like cloud managed types where

you have all these different three-letter acronyms for all

the major cloud providers.

We'll talk about some of those later.

You might want to manage your own distribution

of Kubernetes, whether that's in the cloud, or in your data

center, or in a hybrid where you're doing it on both.

There's lots of choices for you there.

There's some listed here that are some of the major popular

ones right now.

Then there's people that decide that they want to stick

with the vanilla upstream.

Note, this is usually the hardest choice because one

of the advantages of a cloud managed or a vendor provided

solution, even if it's free or not free, is

that it usually is easier to deploy and manage, right.

That's one of the values that these distributions add on

top of the raw open source distributions.

The vanilla upstream, there are definitely some tools out

there. Kubeadm, probably the most popular, but

there's other tools that allow you to deploy clusters of

Kubernetes wherever you'd like,

kind of based on the features of that particular tool.

That's known as a vanilla upstream deployment.

That's definitely one of the more harder ways to manage

Kubernetes, but it allows you to customize and tweak

a relatively unopinionated install.

We'll talk about that opinionated more throughout this

course. Opinionated versus unopinionated means

that Kubernetes comes out-of-the-box with

a whole lot of options and not a lot of opinions.

It allows you to decide how you want to deploy

security with it. What different types of networking and

all sorts of other decisions that you may have to make.

Different distributions will make those choices for you

based on whether that's the vendor that you like

or prefer. That's one of the ways you're going to make a

decision on how you use Kubernetes.

For local testing or using for development, you

might be using Docker Desktop, which is definitely one of

the most popular choices for local use of

Kubernetes. You have other choices here as well.

There's now becoming a list

of tools and ways to deploy Kubernetes for

testing your code inside Kubernetes.

One of those is kind. It stands for Kubernetes in Docker.

Then we have distributions that are a little more

specialized, like Rancher's K3s, which

is a very tiny, minimal feature set

of Kubernetes designed for easier deployment and

management. The founder of K3s actually says

it's the Swarm of Kubernetes.

I don't know if I'll go that far in making it as easy as

Swarm, but it's definitely an easier deployment and

management solution, and it's a pretty neat project you

might want to check out. There's a lot more.

We could go on for many hours

here talking about all the distributions.

You can't even really compare them all because there's so

many, and they come from so many different vendors.

The thing about all of these tools, one of the goals that

the Kubernetes project got so right, early on,

was saying, hey, if you want to be certified by us,

then you have to conform to our API to make sure that

it's compatible with the standard upstream

Kubernetes. Which means you can use the standard tooling,

the standard YAML formats, and all the ways you

would talk to the Kubernetes API.

That's known as a certified distribution, and

all of these, are that, right.

All of those in that link, the many, many more, that 86

distributions.

Those are all certified so that you can be sure

if you need to take your applications from one of these

distributions to another, that you're not going to have to

completely rewrite all of your YAML and commands.
