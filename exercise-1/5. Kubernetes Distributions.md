Before we get into what Kubernetes is and how it does the

things it does, we need to understand a little bit of the

在我们开始学习 Kubernetes 是什么以及它是如何工作的之前，我们需要先了解一点背景知识。
* Before 在…以前; 
* get into 进入；陷入；穿上；习惯于

* a little bit 一点
* a little bit of 一点点

landscape. There's lots of tools and lots of products

那里有很多工具和产品。

out there. Let's just break down a few key terms of

the ecosystem of Kubernetes.

让我们来分析一下 Kubernetes 生态系统的几个关键术语。

* a few 几个; 〔反语〕很多; 一点点
* key term 重要的术语;关键术语;关键用语;关键词目


First, is the vanilla upstream.

首先，是上游的香草。

That is the GitHub repos that store

all of the pure Kubernetes project

source code. You can deploy those with various tools.

这是 GitHub repos，它存储了所有纯Kubernetes项目的源代码。您可以使用各种工具来部署它们。
* source code 源码

Then there are other ways of deploying

Kubernetes as well. There's lots of options.

还有其他部署 Kubernetes 的方法。有很多选择。

If you were to break down the different types of these

distributions, or install options, you might break

them into different types like cloud managed types where

you have all these different three-letter acronyms for all

the major cloud providers.

如果您要分解这些发行版的不同类型，或者安装选项，
你可以把它们分成不同的类型，比如云管理类型，
你有所有这些主要云提供商的三字母缩写。
* are to: 要，是为了
* break down：分解; 将…分成若
* acronym n.首字母缩略词

We'll talk about some of those later.

我们稍后会讨论其中的一些。
* some of 中的一些; 其中一些; 其中的一些

You might want to manage your own distribution

of Kubernetes, whether that's in the cloud, or in your data

center, or in a hybrid where you're doing it on both.

您可能希望管理自己的 Kubernetes 发行版，无论是在云中，还是在数据中心，或是在一个混合的环境中，在这两个环境中都可以使用。
* hybrid adj. 混合的；杂种的

There's lots of choices for you there.

你有很多选择。

There's some listed here that are some of the major popular

ones right now.

这里列出了一些现在最流行的。
* the major popular ones 主要流行的
* some of 中的一些;其中一些;其中的一些

Then there's people that decide that they want to stick

with the vanilla upstream.

还有一些人决定，他们要坚持上游的香草。
* stick with 坚持做; 紧跟; 紧随; 和…呆在一起

Note, this is usually the hardest choice because one

of the advantages of a cloud managed or a vendor provided

solution, even if it's free or not free, is

that it usually is easier to deploy and manage, right.

注意，这通常是最困难的选择，因为云管理或供应商提供的解决方案的优点之一(即使它是免费的或不免费的)通常是更容易部署和管理。
* advantage: 优势

That's one of the values that these distributions add on

top of the raw open source distributions.

这是这些发行版在原始开源发行版之上添加的值之一。

The vanilla upstream, there are definitely some tools out

在香草的上游，肯定有一些工具。
* out there: 在那里

there. Kubeadm, probably the most popular, but

there's other tools that allow you to deploy clusters of

Kubernetes wherever you'd like,

kind of based on the features of that particular tool.

Kubeadm，可能是最流行的，但是还有其他工具可以让你在任何地方部署Kubernetes集群，这是基于特定工具的特性的。
* wherever 在任何地方; 在…的各个地方; 各处; 处处; 在所有…的情况下; 究竟在哪里，究竟到哪儿
* based on 以……为基础；在……基础上，以……为依据
* particular 专指的，特指的; 不寻常的; 格外的; 特别的; 讲究; 挑剔; 细节，详情; 详细资料; 详细介绍材料

That's known as a vanilla upstream deployment.

That's definitely one of the more harder ways to manage

Kubernetes, but it allows you to customize and tweak

a relatively unopinionated install.

We'll talk about that opinionated more throughout this

course. Opinionated versus unopinionated means

that Kubernetes comes out-of-the-box with

a whole lot of options and not a lot of opinions.

It allows you to decide how you want to deploy

security with it. What different types of networking and

all sorts of other decisions that you may have to make.

Different distributions will make those choices for you

based on whether that's the vendor that you like

or prefer. That's one of the ways you're going to make a

decision on how you use Kubernetes.

For local testing or using for development, you

might be using Docker Desktop, which is definitely one of

the most popular choices for local use of

Kubernetes. You have other choices here as well.

There's now becoming a list

of tools and ways to deploy Kubernetes for

testing your code inside Kubernetes.

One of those is kind. It stands for Kubernetes in Docker.

Then we have distributions that are a little more

specialized, like Rancher's K3s, which

is a very tiny, minimal feature set

of Kubernetes designed for easier deployment and

management. The founder of K3s actually says

it's the Swarm of Kubernetes.

I don't know if I'll go that far in making it as easy as

Swarm, but it's definitely an easier deployment and

management solution, and it's a pretty neat project you

might want to check out. There's a lot more.

We could go on for many hours

here talking about all the distributions.

You can't even really compare them all because there's so

many, and they come from so many different vendors.

The thing about all of these tools, one of the goals that

the Kubernetes project got so right, early on,

was saying, hey, if you want to be certified by us,

then you have to conform to our API to make sure that

it's compatible with the standard upstream

Kubernetes. Which means you can use the standard tooling,

the standard YAML formats, and all the ways you

would talk to the Kubernetes API.

That's known as a certified distribution, and

all of these, are that, right.

All of those in that link, the many, many more, that 86

distributions.

Those are all certified so that you can be sure

if you need to take your applications from one of these

distributions to another, that you're not going to have to

completely rewrite all of your YAML and commands.
