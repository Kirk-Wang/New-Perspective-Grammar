At this point, you should have whatever you're going to use

for your Kubernetes cluster.

在这一点上，您应该拥有您将用于 Kubernetes 集群的任何内容。
* use for作……用

Again, it only needs to be one node. But, whether it's

something like Play with Kubernetes, or its Docker Desktop,

or whatever you've got to set up based on previous

lectures. Let's get to it.

同样，它只需要一个节点。
但是，不管是像 Play with Kubernetes，
或它的 Docker Desktop，
或任何你需要根据之前的课程设置的东西。
让我们开始吧。
* something like大约; 左右; 接近
* or whatever 诸如此类

We're going to be using the kubectl command line for a

while. So, let's talk about what that is.

我们将使用 kubectl 命令行一段时间。所以，让我们谈谈那是什么。

This command line tool is going to be talking directly

to the Kubernetes API of your cluster.

这个命令行工具将直接与集群的 Kubernetes API 通信。

The way it knows which node, or

connection, to talk to is a config file.

它知道与哪个节点或连接通信的方式是配置文件。

It's in your home directory underneath the .kube directory.

There's a config. It's a text file.

它在.kube目录下的主目录中。有一个配置。这是一个文本文件。
* underneath prep./adv.在…底下;隐藏(或掩盖)在下面;(指真实的感情或性格)在…表象之下

You can go look at it. It's got two, key pieces of info.

你可以去看看。它有两个关键信息。

Well, maybe three. It's got the API

address. That's basically the IP address, whether it's

localhost or some remote system.

好吧，也许三个。它有 API 地址。
这基本上就是 IP 地址，不管是 localhost 还是某个远程系统。
* basically adv.大体上;基本上;总的说来;从根本上说

It's got the path to the physical server.

Then, it's got the user that you want to

access it as. Then it's got the certificate that

will authenticate you.

它有到物理服务器的路径。
然后，它有你想要访问它的用户。
然后它会获得认证你的证书。
* certificate n.证明;证明书;文凭;结业证书;合格证书
* authenticate v.证明…是真实的;证实

These pieces of information are required for every

Kubernetes cluster you want to talk to.

这些信息对于您想要通信的每个Kubernetes集群都是必需的。

They're often just given

to you by the setup program, especially in simple,

little setups for your host machine that you're on right

now. That's all provided, you know whether it's Docker

Desktop, Minikube, MicroK8s,

you know, whatever it is.

它们通常只是由安装程序提供给您，
特别是在您现在所在的主机的简单、小的设置中。
全部都提供了，
你知道是 
Docker Desktop，Minikube，MicroK8s，
你知道，不管是什么。

Those are all typically automatically configuring

that config file, right. So, we're don't have to worry

about it. When you get to production, just realize that

this is a thing you'll have to manage, and we're going to

talk about context later and how you can change all these

different options to change your connection.

这些都是自动配置配置文件的。
所以我们不用担心。
当你开始生产时，要意识到这是一件你必须管理的事情，
我们稍后会讨论上下文以及你如何改变所有这些不同的选项来改变你的连接。
* typically adv.通常;一般;典型地;具有代表性地;不出所料;果然
* configuring v.(按特定方式)安置;(尤指对计算机设备进行)配置;对(设备或软件进行)设定

But for now, the things should just work based on your

setup from the previous lectures.

Just in case you've heard this discussion, there's actually

a talk on YouTube you can go watch on how to pronounce

kubectl. There's over the years, lots

of ways to say this command line.

但是现在，这些东西应该只根据前面几节课的设置工作。
如果你听过这个讨论，
你可以去 YouTube 上看一个关于kubectl发音的演讲。
多年来，这个命令行有很多种说法。
* pronounce v.发音;读(音);正式宣布(或公布、授予等)

Obviously, we don't want to spell it out.

显然，我们不想把它说出来。

So, we needed to come up with a quick little way to say it.

所以，我们需要想出一种快速的表达方式。
* come up with想出，提出; 设法拿出

At first, there was no official meeting.

起初，没有正式会议。

In fact, the original creators had different opinions

on how to say it, including Cube CTL, Cube Cuddle,

Coob cuddle with a hard C.

事实上，最初的创造者对如何说这个词有不同的看法，包括 
Cube CTL, Cube Cuddle, Coob cuddle 使用一个硬的 C

But the official documentation, now,

I think it was a PR a couple of years ago on one of the

repos, officially calls it cube control.

但是官方文档，我想是几年前的一个 repos 上的 PR，官方称它为 cube control。

So, that's what I want to use.

But there's no wrong way to say it.

Call it whatever you want.

So, now we're to our first exercise on your cluster.

Let's get to that command prompt

and type kubectl get node.

Hopefully, if you get a response, that means that your

command line is working, and you're talking to the server,

and it's sitting you back data.

Usually, this is just the host name of the machine.

If you're a single-node setup like you probably are for

this lab, then you're just going to have that one back.

Obviously, if you had 100 servers, you'd get back a list of

100 servers. They'd show you the roles and

how long that server has been there, the version,

that kind of stuff, right.

But, you know, on our local machine, it's just going to say

that one node. This gets us in to the beginning

of kubectl and that get command is super important.

It's how you get so much information about

your cluster. You can get all the different resource

types, which we'll keep going through throughout this

course. We're starting with nodes because that

is technically a resource type.

We can list the machines themselves.

They are a resource.

You don't necessarily have to type out the full resource

name. In fact, we'll see in a minute how you can get

the abbreviation options.

There's also sometimes a way for you to use single or

plural back and forth.

This isn't always the case.

Not everything has abbreviations.

Not everything has a singular or plural ability.

So, you kind of just got to get used to which ones

work and which ones don't.

I don't know how to explain it any better than that.

But in this case, there is an abbreviation for nodes which

is no. We could type that, or we could type

out node, or nodes, in case

we wanted to use the plural, and they all work.

But wait, there's more to the get.

There's so much more to get.

We can start by changing the way the output happens.

By default, it's going to give you human readable output.

But, that may not be what you always want, or you may want

more information than that.

In this case, I can use get nodes with a -o.

That stands for how I'd like the output to be.

I can say wide, which will give me more information.

But, it does require a wider screen.

So, let me zoom out a little bit and

show you the results. As you can see, there's

a lot of information that we didn't get in the smaller

command, but of course, if I zoomed in, it would,

you know, wrap and be really ugly.

So, it just kind of depends on the machine you're on.

Now, we could change that output from wide

to YAML and we'll get a YAML-friendly

format. It gives us a ton of information.

We can sit here and talk about all these values, but we'll

be working on a lot of these throughout the course.

It just goes on and on there, doesn't it?

It's actually showing me all the images it has stored.

It's showing me heart, heartbeats and memory pressure and

disk pressure, all kinds of stuff.

Wouldn't it be nice if there was something in the middle,

you know, that was more than one line and then maybe not

a bazillion lines?

Well, we could do something like this where we're using a

jq command. This is a utility, jq.

Remember, if you don't have jq installed, you can use

the previous lectures during the setup where I talked about

using the sh pod utility container

that has all these extra tools out-of-the-box with it in

case you don't have this installed on your local system.

In this case, this command line is out putting in

JSON, which is a little more computer friendly.

Then, we're using the pipe at the end of that line and

we're piping it to the jq command, which is a JSON

Parser, and will allow us to filter the output

to our heart's content.

In this case, we're saying return everything in the

items array and then pipe that output,

and then filter it again by going and

getting the metadata names.

You can see those dots there.

They're actually following down the path inside

the JSON. We can get the metadata.name.

Then we can also go find the .status.capacity

information, which is its own array of information.

If you were to either type it, or

in my case, I'm going to copy and paste.

You type that out, you'll notice that we'll get back a

nice, little JSON object where we have

different pieces of information from different parts of the

JSOn all put together in our nice, neat little thing.

But, we're...who wants to do this?

Like this is cool for fancy reports that you may be script

into a shell command, So, instead of memorizing really arbitrary

jq commands and memorizing a JSON syntax,

let's look at other ways

we can get different and more information in a more valuable format out of the API.
