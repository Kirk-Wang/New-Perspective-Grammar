At this point, you should have whatever you're going to use

for your Kubernetes cluster.

Again, it only needs to be one node. But, whether it's

something like Play with Kubernetes, or its Docker Desktop,

or whatever you've got to set up based on previous

lectures. Let's get to it.

We're going to be using the kubectl command line for a

while. So, let's talk about what that is.

This command line tool is going to be talking directly

to the Kubernetes API of your cluster.

The way it knows which node, or

connection, to talk to is a config file.

It's in your home directory underneath the .kube directory.

There's a config. It's a text file.

You can go look at it. It's got two, key pieces of info.

Well, maybe three. It's got the API

address. That's basically the IP address, whether it's

localhost or some remote system.

It's got the path to the physical server.

Then, it's got the user that you want to

access it as. Then it's got the certificate that

will authenticate you.

These pieces of information are required for every

Kubernetes cluster you want to talk to.

They're often just given

to you by the setup program, especially in simple,

little setups for your host machine that you're on right

now. That's all provided, you know whether it's Docker

Desktop, Minikube, MicroK8s,

you know, whatever it is.

Those are all typically automatically configuring

that config file, right. So, we're don't have to worry

about it. When you get to production, just realize that

this is a thing you'll have to manage, and we're going to

talk about context later and how you can change all these

different options to change your connection.

But for now, the things should just work based on your

setup from the previous lectures.

Just in case you've heard this discussion, there's actually

a talk on YouTube you can go watch on how to pronounce

kubectl. There's over the years, lots

of ways to say this command line.

Obviously, we don't want to spell it out.

So, we needed to come up with a quick little way to say it.

At first, there was no official meeting.

In fact, the original creators had different opinions

on how to say it, including Cube CTL, Cube Cuddle,

Coob cuddle with a hard C.

But the official documentation, now,

I think it was a PR a couple of years ago on one of the

repos, officially calls it cube control.

So, that's what I want to use.

But there's no wrong way to say it.

Call it whatever you want.

So, now we're to our first exercise on your cluster.

Let's get to that command prompt

and type kubectl get node.

Hopefully, if you get a response, that means that your

command line is working, and you're talking to the server,

and it's sitting you back data.

Usually, this is just the host name of the machine.

If you're a single-node setup like you probably are for

this lab, then you're just going to have that one back.

Obviously, if you had 100 servers, you'd get back a list of

100 servers. They'd show you the roles and

how long that server has been there, the version,

that kind of stuff, right.

But, you know, on our local machine, it's just going to say

that one node. This gets us in to the beginning

of kubectl and that get command is super important.

It's how you get so much information about

your cluster. You can get all the different resource

types, which we'll keep going through throughout this

course. We're starting with nodes because that

is technically a resource type.

We can list the machines themselves.

They are a resource.

You don't necessarily have to type out the full resource

name. In fact, we'll see in a minute how you can get

the abbreviation options.

There's also sometimes a way for you to use single or

plural back and forth.

This isn't always the case.

Not everything has abbreviations.

Not everything has a singular or plural ability.

So, you kind of just got to get used to which ones

work and which ones don't.

I don't know how to explain it any better than that.

But in this case, there is an abbreviation for nodes which

is no. We could type that, or we could type

out node, or nodes, in case

we wanted to use the plural, and they all work.

But wait, there's more to the get.

There's so much more to get.

We can start by changing the way the output happens.

By default, it's going to give you human readable output.

But, that may not be what you always want, or you may want

more information than that.

In this case, I can use get nodes with a -o.

That stands for how I'd like the output to be.

I can say wide, which will give me more information.

But, it does require a wider screen.

So, let me zoom out a little bit and

show you the results. As you can see, there's

a lot of information that we didn't get in the smaller

command, but of course, if I zoomed in, it would,

you know, wrap and be really ugly.

So, it just kind of depends on the machine you're on.

Now, we could change that output from wide

to YAML and we'll get a YAML-friendly

format. It gives us a ton of information.

We can sit here and talk about all these values, but we'll

be working on a lot of these throughout the course.

It just goes on and on there, doesn't it?

It's actually showing me all the images it has stored.

It's showing me heart, heartbeats and memory pressure and

disk pressure, all kinds of stuff.

Wouldn't it be nice if there was something in the middle,

you know, that was more than one line and then maybe not

a bazillion lines?

Well, we could do something like this where we're using a

jq command. This is a utility, jq.

Remember, if you don't have jq installed, you can use

the previous lectures during the setup where I talked about

using the sh pod utility container

that has all these extra tools out-of-the-box with it in

case you don't have this installed on your local system.

In this case, this command line is out putting in

JSON, which is a little more computer friendly.

Then, we're using the pipe at the end of that line and

we're piping it to the jq command, which is a JSON

Parser, and will allow us to filter the output

to our heart's content.

In this case, we're saying return everything in the

items array and then pipe that output,

and then filter it again by going and

getting the metadata names.

You can see those dots there.

They're actually following down the path inside

the JSON. We can get the metadata.name.

Then we can also go find the .status.capacity

information, which is its own array of information.

If you were to either type it, or

in my case, I'm going to copy and paste.

You type that out, you'll notice that we'll get back a

nice, little JSON object where we have

different pieces of information from different parts of the

JSOn all put together in our nice, neat little thing.

But, we're...who wants to do this?

Like this is cool for fancy reports that you may be script

into a shell command, So, instead of memorizing really arbitrary

jq commands and memorizing a JSON syntax,

let's look at other ways

we can get different and more information in a more valuable format out of the API.
