Let's discuss, real quick, a few basic concepts around

the Kubernetes project.

You might hear different terms, and they essentially all

mean the same thing.

Container management system or container orchestrator?

Those are just fancy terms that basically mean something

that takes containers and manages their execution

across multiple machines with a whole lot

of bells and whistles.

That's really all that was meaning there.

If you look at the project, you might see people calling it

K8s, or kates, or

kube. There's different names.

K8s actually, what that is, is that's K with

eight letters in the middle and then an S on the end.

I call it Kubernetes throughout this course as much as

possible. Occasionally, I might let one of the other terms

slip, but they all mean the same thing.

In fact, you'll notice a lot of third-party tools, there'll

be something like kube something or K 8 something,

and they'll use those abbreviated terms as

part of their name to indicate they're related to

Kubernetes. First up, what are some of the things that

Kubernetes can do right out-of-the-box?

If you've never done orchestration before, this might be

something where you're just wondering why.

Okay, I get it that it can run containers. What else can it

do? Right out-of-the-box, we can say it can take

an image. Let's say it takes this particular image, with

this particular version, and it can spin up five of them,

five containers from that same image, and ensure that the

image is an identical same copy on multiple nodes

so that you don't accidentally have different versions

running.

Then it can also put an internal load balancer

in front of that so that any other containers in the same

cluster can reach those containers

with a reliable endpoint.

Then, we might have it start a different image as 10

containers and maybe this is the web frontend of that

particular app.

In this one, we want it to be public.

That means we want it to be accessible from outside

the cluster. So, we'll create a different type of load

balancer with Kubernetes that allows incoming connections

from the outside.

Because we saw spikes, maybe, with

that particular application, we now need to grow our

cluster, adding more nodes and more resources so that we

can handle the load. Great.

Now we have a new release of one of our apps, so we need to

be able to replace it without taking the old one down

first. We do something called a rolling update

or maybe something different.

In this case, with the rolling type, we would say

we want to replace each one, one at a time.

We can configure all of that through settings so

that our app still runs while it's being updated.

Those are basic features, but Kubernetes

being the most advanced orchestrator we have for containers

right now, there is so much more it can do.

Things including basic auto scaling, which includes

both node auto scaling and application

auto scaling. We'll talk about those two, different types

later. We have different types of updates and deployments.

There's the rolling update that I previously mentioned.

We can also do blue/green deployments or canary

deployments, which are different types of changes.

We can do long running services, which is what you would

think most people would need. You can also do these one-off

things where you can just start an container and it will

clean it up when it's done, it will...

won't try to restart it essentially.

You can do cron based containers where it will schedule

those for an appropriate time based on your cron settings.

You can also overcommit.

This isn't a terribly popular thing, but in case you

have workloads where they don't need to run all the time,

and there may be more batch oriented where you just need to

run them when the cluster has free resources.

You can do things where you can overcommit

a cluster and it will evict lower

priority jobs.

Meaning it will essentially stop those containers while

more important things run.

Then, when there's time and resources available, it will go

back to those other things that need to run that are lower

priority. That's pretty advanced, but it could totally

do that. Of course, I'm sure you've heard about running

databases in containers for better or for worse,

but it can use something known as stateful data, and

stateful sets, and persistent volumes.

All these things are terms related to the idea

of running something that we need to save the files

and data from it after the container exits.

Then, you might need to work in a team, or you need advance

controls around who has permissions to what.

That's known, in some cases, as RBAC or fine

grained access control.

That's where you can give one person maybe read only

to certain areas, or someone else, only access to specific

nodes. Then, we have several features that access

a lot of third-party stuff and integrate it into

Kubernetes. The first one being the service catalog is

where you can use something like plugins,

essentially, that allows Kubernetes to use other

resources. Maybe it would automatically create storage

in the cloud

when you provision it a new container request.

It would go and find that storage and create

that using the cloud's API.

That's known as a Service Catalog, and lots of companies

are adding those. The other thing is Operators, which

I'm particularly excited about.

We'll talk more later in this course, of course, about a

lot of these things. But, the Operators essentially

takes what used to be a lot of management,

like setting up a database cluster,

and it turns it into a specialized Kubernetes command,

including adding functionality to the Kubernetes

API and command line tools to manage that

resource with special features.

It essentially allows you to extend the APIs

and the command line tooling.

It's a pretty neat new feature.
