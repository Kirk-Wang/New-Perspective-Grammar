Let's discuss, real quick, a few basic concepts around

the Kubernetes project.

让我们快速讨论一下 Kubernetes 项目的一些基本概念。

You might hear different terms, and they essentially all

mean the same thing.

你可能会听到不同的术语，它们基本上都是相同的意思。
* essentially本质上; 根本上; 基本上

Container management system or container orchestrator?

容器管理系统还是容器编排器？

Those are just fancy terms that basically mean something

that takes containers and manages their execution

across multiple machines with a whole lot

of bells and whistles.

这些都是一些花哨的术语，它们的基本意思是在多台机器上获取容器并管理它们的执行，并附带大量的附加功能。
* basically adv.大体上;基本上;总的说来;从根本上说
* execution n.处决;实行;执行;实施;表演;(乐曲的)演奏;(艺术品的)制作
* bells and whistles 华丽的点缀
* a whole lot of 堆无聊的话;许多

That's really all that was meaning there.

这就是所有的意思。

If you look at the project, you might see people calling it

K8s, or kates, or

kube. There's different names.

如果你看一下这个项目，你可能会看到人们把它叫做 K8s，或者 kates，或者 kube。有不同的名称。

K8s actually, what that is, is that's K with

eight letters in the middle and then an S on the end.

事实上，这就是K，中间有八个字母，最后是一个S。
* in the middle在中部; 正忙于

I call it Kubernetes throughout this course as much as

possible. Occasionally, I might let one of the other terms

slip, but they all mean the same thing.

我在整个课程中尽可能多地称之为 Kubernetes。有时候，我可能会漏掉另一个术语，但它们都是同一个意思。
* as much as possible 尽量; 尽可能多; 尽可能多的
* occasionally adv.偶然;偶尔;有时候

In fact, you'll notice a lot of third-party tools, there'll

be something like kube something or K 8 something,

事实上，你会注意到很多第三方工具，比如kube之类的或者K 8之类的，
* In fact事实上，其实; 准确地说;确切地说 

and they'll use those abbreviated terms as

part of their name to indicate they're related to

Kubernetes. First up, what are some of the things that

Kubernetes can do right out-of-the-box?

他们会用这些缩写词作为他们名字的一部分来表示他们和 Kubernetes 有关系。
首先，Kubernetes 能做哪些开箱即用的事情?
* abbreviated terms 缩写术语
* part of 部分
* indicate v.表明;显示;象征;暗示;间接提及;示意

If you've never done orchestration before, this might be

something where you're just wondering why.

如果你以前从未做过编排，这可能是你想知道原因的地方。
* wondering v.想知道;想弄明白;

Okay, I get it that it can run containers. What else can it

do? Right out-of-the-box, we can say it can take

an image. Let's say it takes this particular image, with

this particular version, and it can spin up five of them,

five containers from that same image, and ensure that the

image is an identical same copy on multiple nodes

so that you don't accidentally have different versions

running.

好吧，我知道它可以运行容器。它还能做什么?
在开箱即用的情况下，我们可以说它可以使用镜像。
假设它使用这个特定的镜像，这个特定的版本，
它可以旋转它们中的五个，同一个镜像中的五个容器，
并确保这个镜像在多个节点上是相同的拷贝
这样你就不会意外地运行不同的版本。
* particular adj.专指的，特指的(与泛指相对);不寻常的;格外的;特别的;讲究;挑剔
* identical adj.完全同样的;相同的;同一的
* accidentally adv.偶然，偶然地；出其不意地；不知不觉地；不知道为什么恰巧

Then it can also put an internal load balancer

in front of that so that any other containers in the same

cluster can reach those containers

with a reliable endpoint.

然后，它还可以在前面放置一个内部负载平衡器，
以便同一集群中的任何其他容器都可以通过一个可靠的端点到达这些容器。
* in front of 在…前面
* so that 因此; 以便
* any other其他的; 任何其他的; 其他任何一个
* reach v.到达;抵达;引起…的注意;
* reliable adj.可信赖的;可依靠的;真实可信的;可靠的

Then, we might have it start a different image as 10

containers and maybe this is the web frontend of that

particular app.

然后，我们可能让它启动一个不同的镜像作为10个容器，
也许这是该特定应用程序的 web 前端。

In this one, we want it to be public.

在这个例子中，我们希望它是公开的。

That means we want it to be accessible from outside

the cluster. So, we'll create a different type of load

balancer with Kubernetes that allows incoming connections

from the outside.

这意味着我们希望它可以从集群外部访问。
因此，我们将使用Kubernetes创建一个不同类型的负载均衡器，它允许来自外部的连接。
* incoming adj.新当选的;新任的;正到达某地的;刚收到的

Because we saw spikes, maybe, with

that particular application, we now need to grow our

cluster, adding more nodes and more resources so that we

can handle the load. Great.

因为我们在那个特定的应用程序中看到了峰值，
所以现在需要扩展集群，添加更多的节点和资源，
以便处理负载。太好了。

Now we have a new release of one of our apps, so we need to

be able to replace it without taking the old one down

first. We do something called a rolling update

or maybe something different.

现在我们有一个新版本的应用程序，
所以我们需要能够取代它，
而不需要把旧的先拿下来。
我们做了一个叫做滚动更新或者其他的事情。

In this case, with the rolling type, we would say

we want to replace each one, one at a time.

在这种情况下，滚动式，我们会说，我们想更换每一个，一次一个。

We can configure all of that through settings so

that our app still runs while it's being updated.

Those are basic features, but Kubernetes

being the most advanced orchestrator we have for containers

right now, there is so much more it can do.

Things including basic auto scaling, which includes

both node auto scaling and application

auto scaling. We'll talk about those two, different types

later. We have different types of updates and deployments.

There's the rolling update that I previously mentioned.

We can also do blue/green deployments or canary

deployments, which are different types of changes.

We can do long running services, which is what you would

think most people would need. You can also do these one-off

things where you can just start an container and it will

clean it up when it's done, it will...

won't try to restart it essentially.

You can do cron based containers where it will schedule

those for an appropriate time based on your cron settings.

You can also overcommit.

This isn't a terribly popular thing, but in case you

have workloads where they don't need to run all the time,

and there may be more batch oriented where you just need to

run them when the cluster has free resources.

You can do things where you can overcommit

a cluster and it will evict lower

priority jobs.

Meaning it will essentially stop those containers while

more important things run.

Then, when there's time and resources available, it will go

back to those other things that need to run that are lower

priority. That's pretty advanced, but it could totally

do that. Of course, I'm sure you've heard about running

databases in containers for better or for worse,

but it can use something known as stateful data, and

stateful sets, and persistent volumes.

All these things are terms related to the idea

of running something that we need to save the files

and data from it after the container exits.

Then, you might need to work in a team, or you need advance

controls around who has permissions to what.

That's known, in some cases, as RBAC or fine

grained access control.

That's where you can give one person maybe read only

to certain areas, or someone else, only access to specific

nodes. Then, we have several features that access

a lot of third-party stuff and integrate it into

Kubernetes. The first one being the service catalog is

where you can use something like plugins,

essentially, that allows Kubernetes to use other

resources. Maybe it would automatically create storage

in the cloud

when you provision it a new container request.

It would go and find that storage and create

that using the cloud's API.

That's known as a Service Catalog, and lots of companies

are adding those. The other thing is Operators, which

I'm particularly excited about.

We'll talk more later in this course, of course, about a

lot of these things. But, the Operators essentially

takes what used to be a lot of management,

like setting up a database cluster,

and it turns it into a specialized Kubernetes command,

including adding functionality to the Kubernetes

API and command line tools to manage that

resource with special features.

It essentially allows you to extend the APIs

and the command line tooling.

It's a pretty neat new feature.
