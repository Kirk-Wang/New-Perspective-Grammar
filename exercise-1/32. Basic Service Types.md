If you're used to thinking about accessing containers

the way that Docker thinks of it, get ready to rewire

your brain. Because it's a little bit different in

Kubernetes and we have, of course, way more options.

如果你习惯了用 Docker 的方式来访问容器，那么准备好重新连接你的大脑吧。因为在 Kubernetes 有一点不同，当然，我们有更多的选择。
* get ready准备好

To start off with, when you've created these pods so

far, there's nothing stopping the pods

from talking to each other. We'll actually talk about the

networking underlying systems, and CNI, and all of that in

a little bit. Until then, just know that pods, right

now, can still talk to each other if we were trying to talk

directly to IP addresses.

首先，到目前为止，当你已经创建了这些 pod，没有什么可以阻止 pod 彼此通信。我们会讲到网络底层系统，CNI，以及所有这些。在那之前，只要知道pods，现在，如果我们尝试直接和IP地址对话，仍然可以互相通信。

But, what we really want is a stable DNS address

for those pods that we need to talk to.

但是，我们真正想要的是一个稳定的 DNS 地址给那些我们需要通信的 pod。

Maybe you're having an API and you want to put a web

interface in front of that that talks to the API, so it

needs a reliable DNS name to find that

API set of pods.

也许你有一个 API，你想在它前面放一个 web 界面来和 API 通信，所以它需要一个可靠的 DNS 名称来找到那个 API pod 集合。

Maybe it's one pod, maybe it's five replicas of a pod.

也许是一个 pod，也许是五个 pod 的复制品。

It doesn't really matter.

这并不重要。

The point is, the resource we need to make here is

known as services.

重点是，我们需要在这里创建的资源称为服务。

We expose services

by creating these resources that then point

to backend pods.

我们通过创建这些指向后端 pod 的资源来公开服务。

We're going to use the kubectl expose command to

do this. This is one of the many ways that you can create

this resource.

我们将使用 kubectl expose 命令来执行此操作。这是创建此资源的多种方法之一。

There's multiple service types.

有多种服务类型。

In fact, out-of-the-box you get at least a few.

事实上，开箱即用，你至少会得到一些。

Depending on where you're installing Kubernetes and

what add-ons you have, you might have more than a few

options for these services.

根据您安装 Kubernetes 的位置和您拥有的附加组件，您可能有多个用于这些服务的选项。

Remember that CoreDNS we talked about, that's part of

the control plane? Well, this is the first job that that

CoreDNS is going to do.

还记得我们说过的 CoreDNS，那是控制平面的一部分?
这是 CoreDNS 要做的第一项工作。

It's going to provide the DNS resolution for

these services so that other pods in our cluster

can access these pods through its service name.

它将为这些服务提供 DNS 解析，以便集群中的其他 pod 可以通过其服务名称访问这些 pod。

The first two types of these services

everybody gets. We have ClusterIP and NodePort.

每个人都会得到前两种服务。我们有 ClusterIP 和 NodePort。

These are the two that work in every Kubernetes setup.

这是在每个 Kubernetes 设置中都可以使用的两个。

You can imagine, under the hood, a lot of this is

controlled by kube-proxy.

你可以想象，在引擎盖下，这些都是由 kube-proxy 控制的。

The API, of course, is providing the endpoint for us

to configure this. Obviously, these rules are stored

in etcd, but it's kube-proxy out-of-the-box

that's going to control this using largely IP

tables, which is a Linux subsystem that

is a part of the kernel for controlling routing of

packets and firewall stuff.

当然，API 为我们提供了配置端点。显然，这些规则存储在 etcd 中，但它是 kube-proxy 开箱即用的，它将主要使用 IP 表来控制这些规则，这是一个 Linux 子系统，它是内核的一部分，用于控制包路由和防火墙内容。

If you're a Linux guru, you already know all about IP

tables, and I don't need to go down that road with you.

如果你是一个 Linux 专家，你已经知道所有关于 IP 表的知识，我不需要和你一起走这条路。

But, the vast majority of us nowadays

can largely ignore IP tables, especially in

containers, because that's what Docker and Kubernetes are

designed to do. They're allowing those of us that just need

to use this to deploy apps to not have to be experts

in the underlying technology in the kernel on how packets

move around. But we're going to, of course, draw a few

diagrams here to just make sure we've got the concepts

down. The first one up is ClusterIP.

但是，我们大多数人现在基本上可以忽略IP表，特别是在容器中，因为这就是 Docker 和 Kubernetes 的设计目的。他们允许我们这些只需要使用它来部署应用程序的人，而不必成为内核内部有关包如何移动的基础技术的专家。但是，我们当然要在此处绘制一些图表，以确保我们掌握了这些概念。 第一个是 ClusterIP。
* vast majority 绝大多数; 巨大优势

It's the default when we use the expose command.

这是我们使用 expose 命令时的默认设置。

If you don't specify a type of service, it will create a

cluster IP. The big deal about cluster IP's

are that they're only available in the cluster.

如果您不指定服务的类型，它将创建一个集群 IP。
集群 IP 的重要之处在于它们只在集群中可用。

Which means if you're putting them in front of a web

server, the only other pods that will be able to access

it are going to be in that cluster.

这意味着如果你把它们放在一个 web 服务器前面，那么能够访问它的其他 pod 就只能在这个集群中。

It's not good for exposing to the rest of the internet

or something outside the cluster.

它不适合暴露给 internet 的其他部分或集群之外的东西。

That's for NodePort and other types we'll get to later.

这是针对 NodePort 和其他类型的，我们稍后会讲到。

The nice thing with ClusterIP is that when we create it,

it'll use the port that our app is listening on.

ClusterIP 的好处是，当我们创建它时，它将使用我们的应用程序正在监听的端口。

So, we don't have to worry about some high port that we'd

have to memorize, or write down, or configure.

所以，我们不需要担心一些需要记忆，或写下来，或配置的高端口。

That's the limitation of NodePort.

So NodePort is designed to be accessible from

outside of your cluster.

这就是 NodePort 的限制，所以 NodePort 被设计成可以从集群外部访问。

It will pick a port from a really high range

that's free and available on every node, and it will listen

on all the nodes on that port.

它将从一个非常高的范围中选择一个端口，
这个范围在每个节点上都是空闲的，
并且它将监听该端口上的所有节点。

Unfortunately, it's going to be a high number, so it's not

going to be able to use something like 80 out-of-the-box

with this expose command.

不幸的是，这将是一个很高的数字，
所以它不能使用像 80 这样的开箱即用的 expose 命令。
* unfortunately adv. 不幸地;遗憾地;可惜地;可悲地

It's not always the right fit.

它并不总是合适的。

ClusterIP is, of course, since it's just inside your

container, a really easy one to use when you're dealing

with backend services. For stuff that you're going to put

publicly in front of your cluster

and accessed by someone else on the internet, or in your

data center, the most common here is to use

LoadBalancer.

当然，ClusterIP 只是在容器中，
在处理后端服务时非常容易使用。
对于您将公开放在集群前面并由 internet 或
数据中心上的其他人访问的内容，
这里最常见的是使用 LoadBalancer。

LoadBalancer is using an external

third-party service. It might be an external proxy

or some sort of firewall service.

LoadBalancer 正在使用外部第三方服务。它可能是一个外部代理或某种防火墙服务。

If it's in a data center or if it's in the cloud, it's

often going to be that cloud's external load balancer.

如果它在一个数据中心或者在云中，它通常是云的外部负载均衡器。

The cool thing about running Kubernetes, that's provisioned

automatically by the big cloud companies, is that they will

set up this load balancer service for you in your cluster

so that it automatically works when you ask for one.

运行 Kubernetes 很酷的一点是，
它是由大型云公司自动提供的，
它们会在您的集群中为您设置这个负载平衡器服务，
这样当您需要负载平衡器服务时，
它就会自动工作。

The difference is, is that for those of us doing this on

our machine locally, a lot of us won't have this load

balancer option because it typically requires third-party

tooling. The cool thing today is that if you're running

Docker Desktop,

the load balancer is how you can get to use localhost

to expose services to your local machine.

不同之处在于，
对于那些在本地机器上执行此操作的人来说，
很多人都没有这个负载平衡器选项，
因为它通常需要第三方工具。
现在很酷的一件事是，
如果您正在运行Docker Desktop，
那么负载平衡器就是您可以使用 localhost
向本地机器公开服务的方法。

We'll see that as well.

我们也会看到。

Let's back up a second and you'll notice the ClusterIP,

the NodePort, and then the load balancer.

让我们后退一秒，您会注意到 ClusterIP、NodePort，然后是负载平衡器。

Those are actually building on top of each other.

它们实际上是相互叠加的。
* on top of在…之上; 逼近; 胜任; 掌握
* each other互相，彼此

So, when you create a node port type of service,

remember that's the one that gives you a high port that's a

public IP port on all nodes.

因此，当您创建节点端口类型的服务时，
请记住，它会为您提供一个高端口，
即所有节点上的公共 IP 端口。

That node port will then route traffic to a cluster

IP internally to the cluster to get to

your pods. If you choose to have a load balancer, again,

that's largely dependent upon third-party tooling and

services, then that will also create a node

port and a cluster IP to route that traffic

through. We'll see that in a second.

然后，该节点端口将把流量路由到集群内部的集群 IP，
以到达您的 pod。
如果您选择使用负载均衡器(这在很大程度上依赖于第三方工具和服务)，
那么它还将创建一个节点端口和一个集群 IP 来路由通过的流量。
我们马上就会看到。

External name is something where you usually need

to have an internal DNS name inside your cluster,

or something outside your cluster, that you want to

be able to route to and you want to control that name

inside your cluster. It's a it's a pretty special case

thing. It's usually for when the name remotely

might change outside of your cluster, but you

don't want to have to redeploy your services just because

that external service might change.

外部名称通常需要在
集群内部有一个内部 DNS 名称，
或者在集群外部有一个外部名称，
您希望能够路由到该名称，
并希望在集群内部控制该名称。
这是一个非常特殊的情况。
它通常用于在集群之外远程更改名称，
但您不希望仅仅因为外部服务
可能更改就必须重新部署服务的情况。

So, you create this special DNS entry inside

your Kubernetes cluster, and then you can change that on

the fly. Kind of like a CNAME.

因此，您可以在 Kubernetes 集群中创建这个特殊的 DNS 条目，
然后可以动态地更改它。
有点像 CNAME。
* on the fly 在飞行中；忙忙碌碌
* Kind of稍微; 有几分; 有点儿

It won't require you to reprovision your

deployments and your container pods just because

some name on the internet changed.

That's a pretty rare one, I think, but it's still there

as a free option.
