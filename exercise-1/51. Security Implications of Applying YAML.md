It bears repeating, because I like to make sure

that you're fully aware of the security risks of various

decisions you make, that the kubectl

apply command, because it will do anything the YAML

tells it to do, and that YAML could be

huge. It could be a very large file, with lots

of things it's asking to do.

So, essentially, treat this like it's a Superuser.

It could do something like start a Bitcoin miner like the

Tesla incident. It could hide resources

in a non-default namespace so that you didn't see them.

Or, it could hide things in the system namespace so you

wouldn't really pay attention to that if you're just using

a default. It could do things like bind mount host file

systems as root.

It could insert SSH keys into the root account of

the physical server.

It has root on the host machine.

It could encrypt data and cause you to have a ransomware

situation.

It could do lots of stuff. It could kill your servers.

Denial of service. It has complete root.

The difference with this is that it has root on every

server that you have in the cluster.

So, if you have a 100-server cluster, you have a

one-line command that could take down 100 servers or use

100 servers for Bitcoin money.

So, Kubernetes has become a little bit

of a risk scenario because it's so much power.

In fact, this is a nice slide that I completely agree

with on kubectl apply is like the new curl sh.

And, curl sh is a very convenient way

to run a shell script on a system

that you own. On a Linux machine, on a Mac machine.

These systems, you know, with

great power comes great responsibility.

So, if you were doing that on a root account, who knows

what you're running, right.

kubectl apply, as you've seen, allows you to run

these neat web URLs like I'm giving you.

You'll notice that I'm using HTTPS, and that's very

important. Because I control the K8s Mastery

domain and we're using SSL, you can be sure

that the YAML you've asked for is the YAML you're getting.

Though I would, if I were you, before you ever

download any of these YAMLs, I would always just cat them

out. You can download those YAMLs or open it up in your

browser. It's not going to hurt anything in the browser.

You can look at that information before you apply it to

your system, just to be sure.
