The next thing we want to launch before we keep going on

our app is the Dashboard.

在继续使用我们的应用程序之前，我们接下来要启动的是仪表板。
* keep going 继续做; 继续移动;坚持干; 维持下去

We can have another way to look at all these resources

and to visualize, a little bit, some of the stuff in

我们可以用另一种方式来查看所有这些资源，并对集群中的一些内容进行一些可视化。

our cluster. It's a neat way to apply YAML, when

you're in a pinch, and you don't have a command line.

You just want to do it through a web browser.

这是在紧急情况下应用 YAML 的好方法，
而且您没有命令行。
你只需要通过 web 浏览器就可以了。

This is an official project from the Kubernetes

这是 Kubernetes 生态系统的一个官方项目。

ecosystem. It's not just some third party that a person

made. This is the official Kubernetes Dashboard.

它不只是一个人建立的第三方。这是 Kubernetes 官方的仪表盘。

Notice that I've capitalized the title there.

注意，我已经将标题大写了。

That's the official. There are other ones.

这是官方的。还有其他的。

We'll talk about those in a minute.

我们马上会讲到这些。

This is the one that you can get from the Kubernetes GitHub

organization.

这是你可以从 Kubernetes GitHub 组织得到的。

When you go to that repo, there are official steps.

当您转到该存储库时，有官方步骤。

Kubernetes takes extra careful

care to make sure you don't put your

web interface on the Internet without authentication.

Kubernetes 会格外小心，以确保您不会在没有身份验证的情况下将 web 界面放到Internet 上。

Because this Dashboard will give you complete control of

the cluster. You want to be careful where you launch

因为此仪表板将使您完全控制群集。您要小心在启动它的位置。

it. Today, for this, we're going to be using a slightly

modified version that's just easier for us to use in

our lab testing, local environment.

今天，为了这个，我们将使用一个稍微修改过的版本，
这对我们在实验室测试、本地环境中使用更容易。
* slightly adv.略微;稍微;身材瘦小的

If this is a server you're using on the Internet, don't use

this insecure method.

如果这是您在 Internet 上使用的服务器，请不要使用这种不安全的方法。

Use the method from the Kubernetes Dashboard website

on GitHub. They will give you explicit instructions on a

proper secure way to set up.

使用 GitHub 上 Kubernetes 仪表盘网站上的方法。
他们会给你明确的指示，以适当的安全方式进行设置。

Today, we're just trying to demo the functionality.

今天，我们只是想演示一下它的功能。

We could do something fancy with Let's Encrypt and

our own TLS certificates, and we could do other stuff,

but we're not going to do that today.

我们可以用 Let's Encrypt 和
我们自己的 TLS 证书做一些有趣的事情，
我们还可以做其他的事情，但我们今天不打算这样做。

This is, again, a warning that this will leave

a web Dashboard without authentication

on your cluster.

再次提醒您，这将使 Web 仪表板在集群上不经过身份验证。

If it's just on Docker Desktop, or on your local machine,

and you're not exposing it outside your firewall and your

local machine, then you're fine.

如果它只是在 Docker Desktop，
或者在您的本地机器上，
并且您没有将它暴露在防火墙和本地机器之外，
那么就没有问题。

We're going to be using the kubectl apply command for this

again. This insecure Dashboard is going

to create lots of different resources.

我们将再次使用 kubectl apply 命令。
这个不安全的仪表板将创建许多不同的资源。

There's multiple new resources in here that we haven't

talked about yet related to roles inside

the system for permissions.

这里有许多我们尚未讨论的新资源，这些资源与系统内部的角色有关。

We're going to be creating with something called Socat that

will essentially give us an

HTTP URL that then goes to the HTTPS

URL of the Dashboard.

我们将创建一个名为 Socat 的东西，
它实际上会给我们一个 HTTP URL，
然后转到仪表板的 HTTPS URL。

You can go take a look at this YAML later, but it's not

much different from the official one.

您可以稍后去看看这个 YAML，但它与官方版本没有太大的不同。

It adds a few layers that turns it insecure.

它增加了一些层，使它变得不安全。

I'm going to keep saying that insecure part because I don't

want you to accidentally put this on a cloud-hosted system

and expose your password lists Dashboard on

the Internet. We're going to use this kubectl apply here,

and it will get it set up in one command.

我会一直说这个不安全的部分，
因为我不希望你不小心把这个放在云主机系统上，
并在互联网上公开你的密码列表仪表板。
我们将在这里使用这个 kubectl apply，它会在一个命令中设置它。

kubectl apply

-f https

k8smastery.com/insecure-dashboard.yaml.

You'll see all the different resources we're creating here.

您将看到我们在这里创建的所有不同的资源。

Noticing there's some stuff you've never heard before.

注意到有些东西你以前从未听说过。

We'll talk about it later, including the cluster roll

binding that allows us to access the

full root resources with permissions without having

to supply a password.

稍后我们将讨论它，
包括集群角色绑定，
它允许我们使用权限访问完整的根资源，
而无需提供密码。

There's some other stuff in there, too, that we'll talk

about throughout this course.

还有一些其他的东西，我们会在整个课程中讲到。

In order to get our Dashboard, we need to get that port

that it's running on. So, do kubectl get

service dashboard.

为了得到我们的仪表盘，我们需要得到它运行的那个端口。
那么，做 kubectl get service dashboard。

You'll see that we have a NodePort that we can access from

您将看到我们有一个可以从主机访问的节点。

our host. It's on my machine

它在我的机器端口 30671 上。

port 30671.That will, of course, be different

on your machine, but that allows me to access it from

当然，这在您的机器上是不同的，但这允许我从 localhost 访问它。

localhost. When you pull this up in your browser,

if you see this screen, you know it's working.

We have three choices here.

当你在浏览器中打开它，如果你看到这个屏幕，你知道它在工作。

我们有三种选择。

The first one is to basically upload your local

kubeconfig file, which has an authentication

key that you've been using all along.

第一个基本上是上传本地 kubeconfig 文件，它有一个您一直使用的身份验证密钥。

It's like a password, but it's the key.

The certificate key to get to your cluster.

You could do that or you could do a token.

We're not going to do either one of those.

We're just going to click the skip button for now

to save us the time.

We'll talk about that stuff eventually.

Now, we're in the cluster.

You can poke around here, but the point is, is you have all

of your resources on the left.

This isn't really a monitoring solution in terms of storing

monitoring data over time.

This isn't going to replace those types of systems.

It's for administration of the cluster, no more than

what we could already do at the command line until now.

It does have some nice features around clicking the create

button and allowing you to upload YAML.

You can upload the file itself or copy and paste

YAML. Then it's even got a nice, little interface for you

to go through and manually type in things for different

parts of the command line.

So, that's kind of nice.

It has some other basic cluster features over here, as

well as filtering everything by the namespace.

So, you can see a list of the namespaces and only showed

the things you care about.

We're just here to have that as an available

thing for you to look at while we're staring at this

application.

You can see I've got all my worker, and webui, and

other things in here as well.

Let me warn you one more time.

This is technically a backdoor to your cluster.

If someone were to get access to this web interface,

they don't have to click any password.

You click the skip button, they could click the skip

button. When they apply, they have

full permissions to your cluster.

In case you didn't know, major companies like

Tesla have left

this Dashboard open on the Internet and real

Bitcoin miners love to use free resources

on the Internet to mine Bitcoin.

So, let that be a lesson. Try not to let it be you.

That's why this Dashboard comes out-of-the-box with all

those secure defaults.

In case you're on Minikube or MicroK8s,

if you're using either one of those, you could technically

skip this step as well because they have one line commands

to create this Dashboard and set it up securely for

you. In case you're just curious, we're not going to go

through every Dashboard option.

There are literally dozens, if not

potentially a hundred, different Dashboard options for

Kubernetes. They all have pros and cons.

There's a couple of open source ones here.

Kube Web View and Kube Ops View, you might want to check

out. The reality is your distribution that you

will choose when you decide to go real world production-y

type setups, that distribution will

come with a web Dashboard.

Every vendor, I think, that sets up their own Kubernetes,

or allows you to deploy their own Kubernetes.

I think everyone that I've seen, they all have their own

web Dashboards.

If you're going to be in the Cloud, and you're going to use

the major cloud vendor setup, they don't always come with

a Dashboard.

They just give you the generic API endpoint,

allow you to connect nodes, and it's up to you to decide

what Dashboards you want to control.

They're all different, so you're going to need to check

them out. Then, if you need a web Dashboard, check

this one out first. It tends to be the most full featured

and stable.
