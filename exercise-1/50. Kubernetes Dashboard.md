The next thing we want to launch before we keep going on

our app is the Dashboard.

We can have another way to look at all these resources

and to visualize, a little bit, some of the stuff in

our cluster. It's a neat way to apply YAML, when

you're in a pinch, and you don't have a command line.

You just want to do it through a web browser.

This is an official project from the Kubernetes

ecosystem. It's not just some third party that a person

made. This is the official Kubernetes Dashboard.

Notice that I've capitalized the title there.

That's the official. There are other ones.

We'll talk about those in a minute.

This is the one that you can get from the Kubernetes GitHub

organization.

When you go to that repo, there are official steps.

Kubernetes takes extra careful

care to make sure you don't put your

web interface on the Internet without authentication.

Because this Dashboard will give you complete control of

the cluster. You want to be careful where you launch

it. Today, for this, we're going to be using a slightly

modified version that's just easier for us to use in

our lab testing, local environment.

If this is a server you're using on the Internet, don't use

this insecure method.

Use the method from the Kubernetes Dashboard website

on GitHub. They will give you explicit instructions on a

proper secure way to set up.

Today, we're just trying to demo the functionality.

We could do something fancy with Let's Encrypt and

our own TLS certificates, and we could do other stuff,

but we're not going to do that today.

This is, again, a warning that this will leave

a web Dashboard without authentication

on your cluster.

If it's just on Docker Desktop, or on your local machine,

and you're not exposing it outside your firewall and your

local machine, then you're fine.

We're going to be using the kubectl apply command for this

again. This insecure Dashboard is going

to create lots of different resources.

There's multiple new resources in here that we haven't

talked about yet related to roles inside

the system for permissions.

We're going to be creating with something called Socat that

will essentially give us an

HTTP URL that then goes to the HTTPS

URL of the Dashboard.

You can go take a look at this YAML later, but it's not

much different from the official one.

It adds a few layers that turns it insecure.

I'm going to keep saying that insecure part because I don't

want you to accidentally put this on a cloud-hosted system

and expose your password lists Dashboard on

the Internet. We're going to use this kubectl apply here,

and it will get it set up in one command.

kubectl apply

-f https

k8smastery.com/insecure-dashboard.yaml.

You'll see all the different resources we're creating here.

Noticing there's some stuff you've never heard before.

We'll talk about it later, including the cluster roll

binding that allows us to access the

full root resources with permissions without having

to supply a password.

There's some other stuff in there, too, that we'll talk

about throughout this course.

In order to get our Dashboard, we need to get that port

that it's running on. So, do kubectl get

service dashboard.

You'll see that we have a NodePort that we can access from

our host. It's on my machine

port 30671.That will, of course, be different

on your machine, but that allows me to access it from

localhost. When you pull this up in your browser,

if you see this screen, you know it's working.

We have three choices here.

The first one is to basically upload your local

kubeconfig file, which has an authentication

key that you've been using all along.

It's like a password, but it's the key.

The certificate key to get to your cluster.

You could do that or you could do a token.

We're not going to do either one of those.

We're just going to click the skip button for now

to save us the time.

We'll talk about that stuff eventually.

Now, we're in the cluster.

You can poke around here, but the point is, is you have all

of your resources on the left.

This isn't really a monitoring solution in terms of storing

monitoring data over time.

This isn't going to replace those types of systems.

It's for administration of the cluster, no more than

what we could already do at the command line until now.

It does have some nice features around clicking the create

button and allowing you to upload YAML.

You can upload the file itself or copy and paste

YAML. Then it's even got a nice, little interface for you

to go through and manually type in things for different

parts of the command line.

So, that's kind of nice.

It has some other basic cluster features over here, as

well as filtering everything by the namespace.

So, you can see a list of the namespaces and only showed

the things you care about.

We're just here to have that as an available

thing for you to look at while we're staring at this

application.

You can see I've got all my worker, and webui, and

other things in here as well.

Let me warn you one more time.

This is technically a backdoor to your cluster.

If someone were to get access to this web interface,

they don't have to click any password.

You click the skip button, they could click the skip

button. When they apply, they have

full permissions to your cluster.

In case you didn't know, major companies like

Tesla have left

this Dashboard open on the Internet and real

Bitcoin miners love to use free resources

on the Internet to mine Bitcoin.

So, let that be a lesson. Try not to let it be you.

That's why this Dashboard comes out-of-the-box with all

those secure defaults.

In case you're on Minikube or MicroK8s,

if you're using either one of those, you could technically

skip this step as well because they have one line commands

to create this Dashboard and set it up securely for

you. In case you're just curious, we're not going to go

through every Dashboard option.

There are literally dozens, if not

potentially a hundred, different Dashboard options for

Kubernetes. They all have pros and cons.

There's a couple of open source ones here.

Kube Web View and Kube Ops View, you might want to check

out. The reality is your distribution that you

will choose when you decide to go real world production-y

type setups, that distribution will

come with a web Dashboard.

Every vendor, I think, that sets up their own Kubernetes,

or allows you to deploy their own Kubernetes.

I think everyone that I've seen, they all have their own

web Dashboards.

If you're going to be in the Cloud, and you're going to use

the major cloud vendor setup, they don't always come with

a Dashboard.

They just give you the generic API endpoint,

allow you to connect nodes, and it's up to you to decide

what Dashboards you want to control.

They're all different, so you're going to need to check

them out. Then, if you need a web Dashboard, check

this one out first. It tends to be the most full featured

and stable.
