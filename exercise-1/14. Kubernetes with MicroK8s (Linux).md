If you're a Linux Desktop individual, then

this video is for you.

Microk8s is a really cool piece of technology

for automating and managing the install of Kubernetes.

But, for this course, I'm going to say you should

probably focus on this just for Linux.

Technically, it can run on Linux, Mac,

Windows, Cloud, anything you can think of.

It's a pretty flexible technology.

It uses snap, which is a different type of installation

packaging format than apt or yum.

But, since you already have all the other options that we

just talked about, Docker Desktop, Minikube, all

these things that I'm reserving this option

for if you are just on a Linux Desktop or maybe

you're using a VM in the Cloud or maybe you got a server at

home, and you just want to run Linux VM there.

That's fine. I'm going to give you a demo of installing it

on a Linux Desktop using Mint, which is a variant of

Ubuntu. And it works the same way regardless of your

distribution, as long as you get snap installed first.

Now, microk8s is created by Canonical.

They're the same company that creates Ubuntu.

They were part of the team that created the snap

installation method. It's a different type of packaging

format, so you're probably going to need to get

snap installed first. You can use yum or apt,

the standard package managers, to get

snap installed. Then once snap is installed, you can

install microk8s.

Now, microk8s is an installation

management tool for Kubernetes locally on

your Linux machine. There's three levels here.

First, snap. Then microk8s, and it will then install

Kubernetes and manage it for you.

Now microk8s itself, the command line, the little tool,

it has a lot of different options, like start and stop, and

a bunch of other add-ons that it can install.

But, I just want to show you the basics so we can get

started fast.

We're going to focus on the three steps.

Getting snap installed, and logging out

and logging in, in order for snap to be added to your

path. Then we're going to get

microk8s installed and then change the group

settings so that you have access to manage

the Kubernetes installation without having to be sudo.

Because throughout this course, you're going to be typing

lots of commands and typing sudo, and typing in your

password on every one of them, could be tedious.

So, for a lab install, we're going to do these steps.

This is not a production setup like the rest of these.

We'll get to production setups later in the course.

For now, we're going to focus on just getting it on your

local machine so that you can have an easy way to

play with it. All right. Here I am on my

Mint machine, which is just a variant of Ubuntu.

But, I can type snap and I don't have snap installed.

So my package manager is saying you need to do a sudo

apt install snapd.

And once you have snap installed, you're probably going to

need to log out so that you can get the proper

user settings, specifically group membership and paths

for snap to work.

Now that I'm logged back in and snap is installed, I can do

a sudo snap install microk8s --classic.

Now, it doesn't mean that it's a classic edition

of Kubernetes. That's not what we're doing.

It's just a setting inside of snap that means give

this.

program that were about to install more permissions and

more access than normally because microk8s

is running Kubernetes and Kubernetes needs lots of access

to the file system. It needs root.

It needs access to the kernel in ways that a normal program

doesn't. So, the classic is just their way of saying,

install it like a classically installed program, I guess.

It looks like my microk8s is installed.

Now, it will tell you the version, which is the same

version as Kubernetes.

So, I know I am running 1.16.3.

By default, we can access the kubectl command line.

You haven't learned so much about this yet, but kubectl is

the main way we interface with Kubernetes from the command

line. So, I can do a microk8s

kubectl.

And you notice that it's going to complain to me.

It's going to say, hey, look, you really...you either need

to do sudo or why don't you just add

yourself to a group so you can have access to manage this

without sudo. That's what we're going to do.

You can copy and paste that command tp your command line.

Or, type it in like I'm going to do.

Then the last part of it is your name.

You're going to add that, but again, you're going to have

to log back out in order to get those group

settings to take effect on Linux.

The last thing we need to do is set up an alias for the

command. You can type in kubectl like the rest

of us and you'll be getting the same command results

that we do without having to type microk8s.kubectl.

All

you really need to do there is set up an alias like you

normally would in a bash or any other major

Linux shell prompt.

But, what I want you to do is add that to your bashrc.

So you could do something like.

echo alias kubectl

microK8s.kubectl '" and

then if you put in two greater than symbols, that says add

it to the end of this file, and you can say bashrc.

That's if you're using bash. If you're using zsh or fish or

something else, then you would need to add this to one

of the files that automatically gets loaded when you start

up that shell. So, you could do that and

then it would allow you to type the kubectl command.

The way you know you've done this correctly is

you can type kubectl versions and you get back the

results, and you don't have to type in sudo.

Now, if you're a security concern and you're very

much about security, maybe it's a server on the Internet and you

just absolutely do not want to give your local user

permissions, I'm not asking you or

forcing you to do sudo there. It's really up to you.

You don't have to give yourself permissions and log out and

log in. You could still type sudo on every command.

It's just an extra step.

Reality is when you're in production on servers that

sudo is a necessary step, unless you're already root.

Sudo is something that you should do.

You should be manually forcing yourself to do that.

But for local testing and local learning, I

consider that those things are optional.

This is also true of Docker and the other Docker tooling. On

Linux, by default, you would normally have to type sudo.

But, lots of us add ourself to the Docker group just

so that it's easier and more convenient for local use.

It's up to you whether you do that or not.
