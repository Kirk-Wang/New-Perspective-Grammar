Microk8s is a really cool piece of technology

for automating and managing the install of Kubernetes.

Microk8s 是一项非常酷的技术，用于自动化和管理 Kubernetes 的安装。

But, for this course, I'm going to say you should

probably focus on this just for Linux.

但是，对于这门课，我想说的是，你应该把注意力放在 Linux 上。

Technically, it can run on Linux, Mac,

Windows, Cloud, anything you can think of.

从技术上讲，它可以运行在 Linux、Mac、Windows、Cloud 上，
任何你能想到的东西。

It's a pretty flexible technology.

这是一种非常灵活的技术。

It uses snap, which is a different type of installation

packaging format than apt or yum.

它使用 snap，这是一种不同于 apt 或 yum 的安装打包格式。

But, since you already have all the other options that we

just talked about, Docker Desktop, Minikube, all

these things that I'm reserving this option

for if you are just on a Linux Desktop or maybe

you're using a VM in the Cloud or maybe you got a server at

home, and you just want to run Linux VM there.

但是，既然你已经有了我们刚才讨论过的所有其他选项，
Docker Desktop，Minikube，所有这些我保留的选项，
如果你只是在 Linux Desktop 上，
或者你在云中使用虚拟机，
或者你在家里有一个服务器，
你只想在那里运行 Linux 虚拟机。

That's fine. I'm going to give you a demo of installing it

on a Linux Desktop using Mint, which is a variant of

Ubuntu. And it works the same way regardless of your

distribution, as long as you get snap installed first.

没关系。我将给你一个在 Linux Desktop 上安装 Mint 的演示，
Mint 是 Ubuntu 的一个变种。
而且无论您的发行版是什么，
只要您先安装 snap，它的工作方式都是一样的。

Now, microk8s is created by Canonical.

现在，microk8s 是由 Canonical 公司创建的。

They're the same company that creates Ubuntu.

他们是创建 Ubuntu 的同一家公司。

They were part of the team that created the snap

installation method. It's a different type of packaging

format, so you're probably going to need to get

snap installed first. You can use yum or apt,

the standard package managers, to get

snap installed. Then once snap is installed, you can

install microk8s.

他们是创建 snap 安装方法的团队的一员。
它是一种不同类型的打包格式，所以您可能需要先安装 snap。
您可以使用标准包管理器 yum 或 apt 来安装 snap。
安装 snap 后，就可以安装 microk8s。

Now, microk8s is an installation

management tool for Kubernetes locally on

your Linux machine. There's three levels here.

First, snap. Then microk8s, and it will then install

Kubernetes and manage it for you.

现在，microk8s 是 Kubernetes 在您的 Linux 机器上的本地安装管理工具。
这里有三层。
首先, snap。然后是 microk8s，
它会安装 Kubernetes 并为你管理它。

Now microk8s itself, the command line, the little tool,

it has a lot of different options, like start and stop, and

a bunch of other add-ons that it can install.

现在是 microk8s 本身，命令行，
这个小工具，它有很多不同的选项，
比如开始和停止，还有一堆它可以安装的附加组件。

But, I just want to show you the basics so we can get

started fast.

但是，我只是想向你们展示一些基础知识，这样我们就可以快速开始了。

We're going to focus on the three steps.

我们将关注这三个步骤。

Getting snap installed, and logging out

and logging in, in order for snap to be added to your

path. Then we're going to get

microk8s installed and then change the group

settings so that you have access to manage

the Kubernetes installation without having to be sudo.

安装 snap，然后退出和登录，
以便 snap 被添加到您的路径中。
然后我们将安装 microk8s，然后更改组设置，
以便您可以管理 Kubernetes 安装，而不必是 sudo。

Because throughout this course, you're going to be typing

lots of commands and typing sudo, and typing in your

password on every one of them, could be tedious.

因为在整个课程中，你要输入很多命令，
输入 sudo，然后在每一个上面输入你的密码，
可能会很繁琐。
* tedious adj.冗长的;啰唆的;单调乏味的;令人厌烦的

So, for a lab install, we're going to do these steps.

所以，对于实验室安装，我们将执行以下步骤。

This is not a production setup like the rest of these.

这不是一个生产设置像其余的这些。

We'll get to production setups later in the course.

我们将在本课程的后面进行生产设置。

For now, we're going to focus on just getting it on your

local machine so that you can have an easy way to

play with it. All right. Here I am on my

Mint machine, which is just a variant of Ubuntu.

现在，我们将把重点放在本地机器上，这样您就可以轻松地使用它。
好吧。这是我的 Mint machine，它只是 Ubuntu 的一个变种。

But, I can type snap and I don't have snap installed.

但是，我可以输入 snap，并且我没有安装 snap。

So my package manager is saying you need to do a sudo

apt install snapd.

所以我的包管理者告诉你需要做一个 sudo apt 安装 snapd。

And once you have snap installed, you're probably going to

need to log out so that you can get the proper

user settings, specifically group membership and paths

for snap to work.

安装了 snap 之后，您可能需要注销才能获得正确的用户设置，
特别是组成员关系和 snap 的工作路径。

Now that I'm logged back in and snap is installed, I can do

a sudo snap install microk8s --classic.

现在我已经重新登录并安装了 snap，我可以做一个 sudo snap install microk8s --classic。

Now, it doesn't mean that it's a classic edition

of Kubernetes. That's not what we're doing.

这并不意味着它是 Kubernetes 的经典版本。那不是我们正在做的。

It's just a setting inside of snap that means give

this.

它只是 snap 中的一个设置，意思是给这个。

program that were about to install more permissions and

more access than normally because microk8s

is running Kubernetes and Kubernetes needs lots of access

to the file system. It needs root.

因为 microk8s 运行的是 Kubernetes，
而 Kubernetes 需要对文件系统进行大量访问，
所以将要安装更多权限和访问权限的程序。
它需要 root 权限。

It needs access to the kernel in ways that a normal program

doesn't. So, the classic is just their way of saying,

install it like a classically installed program, I guess.

它需要以普通程序不具备的方式访问内核。
所以，经典的是他们说的方式，安装它像一个经典安装的程序，我猜。

It looks like my microk8s is installed.

看起来我的 microk8s 已经安装好了。

Now, it will tell you the version, which is the same

version as Kubernetes.

它会告诉你这个版本，和 Kubernetes 的版本是一样的。

So, I know I am running 1.16.3.

所以，我知道我在运行 1.16.3。

By default, we can access the kubectl command line.

默认情况下，我们可以访问 kubectl 命令行。

You haven't learned so much about this yet, but kubectl is

the main way we interface with Kubernetes from the command

line. So, I can do a microk8s

kubectl.

And you notice that it's going to complain to me.

It's going to say, hey, look, you really...you either need

to do sudo or why don't you just add

yourself to a group so you can have access to manage this

without sudo. That's what we're going to do.

You can copy and paste that command tp your command line.

Or, type it in like I'm going to do.

Then the last part of it is your name.

You're going to add that, but again, you're going to have

to log back out in order to get those group

settings to take effect on Linux.

The last thing we need to do is set up an alias for the

command. You can type in kubectl like the rest

of us and you'll be getting the same command results

that we do without having to type microk8s.kubectl.

All

you really need to do there is set up an alias like you

normally would in a bash or any other major

Linux shell prompt.

But, what I want you to do is add that to your bashrc.

So you could do something like.

echo alias kubectl

microK8s.kubectl '" and

then if you put in two greater than symbols, that says add

it to the end of this file, and you can say bashrc.

That's if you're using bash. If you're using zsh or fish or

something else, then you would need to add this to one

of the files that automatically gets loaded when you start

up that shell. So, you could do that and

then it would allow you to type the kubectl command.

The way you know you've done this correctly is

you can type kubectl versions and you get back the

results, and you don't have to type in sudo.

Now, if you're a security concern and you're very

much about security, maybe it's a server on the Internet and you

just absolutely do not want to give your local user

permissions, I'm not asking you or

forcing you to do sudo there. It's really up to you.

You don't have to give yourself permissions and log out and

log in. You could still type sudo on every command.

It's just an extra step.

Reality is when you're in production on servers that

sudo is a necessary step, unless you're already root.

Sudo is something that you should do.

You should be manually forcing yourself to do that.

But for local testing and local learning, I

consider that those things are optional.

This is also true of Docker and the other Docker tooling. On

Linux, by default, you would normally have to type sudo.

But, lots of us add ourself to the Docker group just

so that it's easier and more convenient for local use.

It's up to you whether you do that or not.
