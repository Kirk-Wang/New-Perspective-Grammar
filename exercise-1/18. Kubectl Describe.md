You remember in the last lecture, I said wouldn't

it be nice if there was a format in between having really

long custom commands to give what we want and the

get command with the output YAML that gives us a ton of

information, or that tiny little get node command that only

gave us like three or four pieces of information.

你还记得在上节课中，
我说过，
如果有一种格式
介于
使用非常长的自定义命令来提供我们想要的内容
和
使用输出 YAML 来提供大量信息的 get 命令
之间，
或者是一个很小的 get node 命令，
它只提供了大约三到四条信息，这不是很好吗。

Well, cool that there is, because

we are going to talk about, describe.

Describe is an interesting command.

It's largely human readable format, and

it's something we don't really have in Docker.

好吧，很酷，因为我们要谈谈，describe。
Describe 是一个有趣的命令。
它基本上是人类可读的格式，
而这是我们在 Docker 中没有的东西。

It maybe would be analogous to something we might have seen

in Docker Compose where we give us a nice little format

of information about just what we care about. But in this case, let's

just run it and take a look. Now you'll need the node name

of your node. That was the kubectl get

nodes command that gave you

the name of your node. We'll need that name, whatever

your name is, whether it's Docker -desktop, or Minikube, or

you know, the name of your host if you're on a Linux

machine. Go get that name real quick and you're going to

type that into a describe command.

它可能类似于我们可能在 Docker Compose 中看到的东西，
在 Docker Compose 中，我们为我们所关心的东西提供了一个很好的信息格式。
但在这种情况下，我们运行一下，看一下。
现在需要节点的节点名。
这是 kubectl get nodes 命令，它给出了节点的名称。
我们需要这个名字，不管你叫什么名字，
不管是 Docker -desktop
还是 Minikube，
或者你知道，
或者是 Linux 机器上主机的名字。
快速获取该名称，然后将其键入 descripe 命令。

* be analogous to 与…相似
* care about 在意

You see the angle brackets.

你可以看到尖括号。

That's where you need to fit in your node name.

这就是需要放入节点名的地方。

On my machine, if I just type kubectl get

nodes, I see that my name for my machine is docker-desktop.

So, if I type kubectl describe node/

the name of the node, docker-desktop, I'll get this output.

It's a ton of information.

We're not going to go through all of this because we're

going to break it down later, but definitely take a minute,

pause the video, and look through all of the

great stuff.

In fact, if I zoom out to the point that you can't

even read my screen, I can see how

it's showing me pods running.

It's showing me resource information.

Overall information about the node itself.

There's a lot of stuff here.

We haven't even got started.

In fact, you'll notice that on my machine, I've got a lot

of stuff running. That's because we've got a bunch of

objects running inside containers to run

Kubernetes, right. We got the API, remember that CoreDNS

thing we talked about.

If you're on Docker Desktop, you've probably got more stuff

here. That's because every distribution runs

slightly different stuff for networking.

Maybe some extra utilities.

We're all going to be slightly different, depending on our

distribution. Besides the coolness of the describe command

that I want you to check out on your own, that works for

all resource types, by the way. I want you to notice the

format of what I just typed.

Because that's a key piece of information that you're going

to use throughout your life in Kubernetes.

That is the resource type name, and hen

the resource itself. The resource name.

You'll notice that you can either use a slash or a space

here. As we explore more resource types

in a minute, you'll notice that same format for using

commands that you can either use the slash or

the space. Either one works.

I will use both throughout this course just so that you can

see and remember that you can use both.

You'll probably be settling on your own way of doing it.

There's no better way. It's just the same.
